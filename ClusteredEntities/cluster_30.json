Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift.

            "originalText": "(Fig. 5B, C). Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running",

PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001).

The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic A band does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift. PS 50values were\ncalculated using Prism software (GraphPad) by ﬁtting a sigmoid\ndose-response curve to onset times in days 0–6 after light cycle shift\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org",

When it was not possible to measure the height, \nbecause the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm3), the tumour \nvolume was calculated as (1/2) × length × width2.\nPreparation of fresh solutions of Cy7.5-amine and DMSO for \nin vivo studies\nOn the day of treatment, a fresh solution of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine was \nprepared by diluting the 8 mM Cy7.5-amine stock in DMSO in PBS \nbuffer; the final dilution contained 2.5% DMSO. A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3. The volume of the tumours was calculated as (1/2) × len\ngth × width × height. When it was not possible to measure the height, because the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm\n3), the tumour \n",
