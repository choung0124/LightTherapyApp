            "originalText": "in the development and function of the nervous system\n(Nguyen et al. 2018; Olde Loohuis et al. 2012). miRNAs have\nemerged as key elements in circadian clock regulation in\nrecent times. Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well",

Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021).

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream.

Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].

The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells.

In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .

Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].

Because melatonin is highly amphiphilic, it flows through the pineal gland recess to reach the cerebrospinal fluid and the circulation as means of the pineal gland activity. Activation of the immune-pineal axis was shown to be a major regulator of the transcription, and protein availability, of the enzyme AANAT. ASD individuals present high levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, which is correlated with the reduced produc-tion of melatonin. On the other hand, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also described for the gene coding for ASMT in ASD subjects. B) individuals with normal-development present a high urinary excretion levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (a6MTs), suggesting a high fidedignity between the nocturnal pro-duction and excretion of melatonin metabolites (blue lines). Conversely, a6MTs levels in ASD is reduced (red lines) or even a phase-shifted excretion levels, suggesting that reduction of the nocturnal melatonin is impaired.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

            "originalText": "One of the most apparent outputs of the circadian \nclock is the sleep–wake cycle. Timing of sleep is deter ­\nmined by two factors: the need to sleep — also called \nsleep pressure — and the circadian clock169. Sleep tim­\ning and duration are highly sensitive to the internal \nand external state of the animal, which is controlled by \nthe coordinated action of neuronal and glial circuits, including the central pacemaker, intracellular factors, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and can be \ninfluenced by the immune system and metabolism \n(reviewed in\n170). Clock ­ less flies can have normal total \namounts of sleep, despite it being randomly distributed \nacross day and night171. Conversely, sleep mutant flies \ncan exhibit normal rhythmicity despite overall reduced sleep\n172– 174. Nevertheless, separating the two processes \ngenetically can be complicated owing to some genes having roles in both processes, as a substantial pro ­\nportion of flies in some sleep mutant populations also \nappear to be arrhythmic\n172– 174. For example, the sleep \ngene encoding Wide awake, whose disruption reduces \nthe duration of daily sleep, is expressed in and affects  \nclock neurons in a circadian manner, thereby showing \nthe interconnectedness of mechanisms controlling sleep and circadian rhythms\n175. Reciprocally, various manipu­\nlations of circadian genes and neurons have an effect on \nsleep176. Notably, mutants of the clock gene cyc  display \nreduced rebound sleep after sleep deprivation177,178. Like \nmammals, hungry D. melanogaster sleep poorly; this starvation­ induced sleep deprivation is mediated by \nclk and cyc , pointing towards regulatory integration of \ntwo homeostatic behaviours — feeding and sleep — by \nthe circadian clock\n179. The DN1 subset of clock neu­\nrons regulates both wake and sleep at different times of \nthe day180, 181, and recent work showed that these neu­\nrons also integrate temperature to regulate the timing of sleep\n182.\nThe circadian clock also regulates mating by influ­\nencing the production of sex pheromones in secretory \ncells called oenocytes. The oenocyte clock functions cell­ autonomously; however, the neuropeptide PDF, \nwhich is released by master clock neurons in the central \nbrain, is required to set the correct phase of the oeno­\ncyte clock and thereby of sex hormone production\n183. \nMemory formation is an example of a neuronal process \nthat, although being located in the brain, is downstream \nand therefore, by our definition, peripheral to the central clock. Similar to what was described for honeybees at the beginning of the twentieth century\n184, flies remember a \nspecific odour stimulus learned at a certain time of day, \nand reproduce the correct stimulus–time pair the next \nday. In this form of appetitive learning, a functioning cir ­\ncadian clock is only needed to encode time­ of­day infor ­\nmation, not for memory formation per se: clock­ less \nD. melanogaster are still able to learn a specific stimulus, but time­ of­day information is lost\n185. A novel addition \nto the list of processes and organs regulated by the clock \nis the blood–brain barrier. A recent study showed that \nD. melanogaster  perineurial glia, which form the out­\nermost layer of the brain, need a functioning clock to modulate diurnal oscillations of a xenobiotic transporter, \nwhich prevents import of toxic substances into the brain \nin a time­ of­day­ dependent manner\n186.Peripheral clocks in mammals\nThe discovery of circadian rhythms in cultured fibro­blast cell lines some 20 years ago led to the realization \nthat, contrary to long­ standing belief, the molecular \nclock of mammals operates not just in the SCN, but \nin virtually all the tissues and cells of the body\n187, 188. \nTo date, peripheral clocks have been described in the \nliver, lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscles, adipose tis­\nsue and many other tissues (Fig.  5). A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191. There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian",

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.

Because melatonin is highly amphiphilic, it flows through the pineal gland recess to reach the cerebrospinal fluid and the circulation as means of the pineal gland activity. Activation of the immune-pineal axis was shown to be a major regulator of the transcription, and protein availability, of the enzyme AANAT. ASD individuals present high levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, which is correlated with the reduced produc-tion of melatonin. On the other hand, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also described for the gene coding for ASMT in ASD subjects. B) individuals with normal-development present a high urinary excretion levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (a6MTs), suggesting a high fidedignity between the nocturnal pro-duction and excretion of melatonin metabolites (blue lines). Conversely, a6MTs levels in ASD is reduced (red lines) or even a phase-shifted excretion levels, suggesting that reduction of the nocturnal melatonin is impaired. Indeed, a6MTS rhythmic alterations were correlated with the activation of the immune-pineal axis.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.
