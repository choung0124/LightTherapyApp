As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic A band does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift. PS 50values were\ncalculated using Prism software (GraphPad) by ﬁtting a sigmoid\ndose-response curve to onset times in days 0–6 after light cycle shift\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org",

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

            "originalText": "BMAL1 acetylation by CLOCK promotes its interaction \nwith CRY1 and is reversed by SIRT1, whereas acetyl­\nation of the same residue by TIP60 enables productive \ntranscription elongation124– 126. REV ­ ERBα is another \nreported GSK3 target, although in this case the modifi­\ncation protects it from degradation mediated by the E3 \nligases ARF ­ BP1 (also known as HUWE1) and PAM (also \nknown as MYCBP2)127,128. REV ­ ERBα degradation medi­\nated by another E3 ligase, SIAH2, affects the circadian \nperiod length, whereas its degradation by the E3 ubiquitin \nligase FBXW7 following CDK1 ­mediated phosphoryla ­\ntion controls circadian amplitude, meaning the difference between the peak and trough values of the oscillation\n129,130.\nThe negative elements of the core molecular clock \nassemble into large multi­ protein complexes that contain \nall three PER proteins, both CRY proteins and CK1δ, into which CLOCK and BMAL1 are incorporated in the nucleus\n131. When purified from liver nuclear extracts, all \nof these proteins appear to be part of the same 1.9­MDa \ncomplex. However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

            "originalText": "). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype. Microglia are\nheavily implicated in AD pathophysiology and microglia activation\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org",

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic A band does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift. PS 50values were\ncalculated using Prism software (GraphPad) by ﬁtting a sigmoid\ndose-response curve to onset times in days 0–6 after light cycle shift\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org",
