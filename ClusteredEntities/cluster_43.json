Interestingly, a recent study on MIA in\nmice demonstrated a link between circadian disruption\nand neurodevelopmental disorder (Delorme et al. 2021).These ﬁndings suggest a possible impact of prenatal\ncircadian disruption on ASD-risk in the offspring and also\nindicate the possibility of direct detrimental effects of a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm during prenatal development\non immunological sequelae and risk to ASD in offspring,\niii) Another possible mechanism through which circadian\nrhythm could alter immune functioning is through\nalteration of the gut microbiota. Dysregulated circa-\ndian rhythm has long-lasting effects on gut microbiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated withinsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gut microbiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninﬂuences the host ’s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional os-cillations and may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel in ﬂammation, including neuroin ﬂammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to dis-\neases, including neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiotaalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressfulconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay betweencircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O\n2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a signi ﬁcant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxida-tive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS medi-\nated oxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disul ﬁde\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012).

A recent study reported higher levels of\noxidative stress damage and lower levels of antioxidant\nresponses in night shift workers compared to day workers\n(Teixeira et al. 2019).\nGenes regulating oxidative stress are also influenced\nby circadian clock. Syrian hamsters exposed to contin-\nuous light for two weeks had diminished expression ofantioxidants like SOD, CAT, and GR compared to controls\n(Tomas-Zapico et al. 2003). Knockout studies of PER gene\nin mice showed that the production of SOD1 was linked to\nthe circadian rhythm and that rhythmicity was abolished\nin PER knockout mice (Jang et al. 2011).

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

            "originalText": "accomplished via rhythmic expression of genes encoding regulators and enzymes\nof important metabolic pathways. The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription.

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensingpathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitrycan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepaticgluconeogenesis [ 25,26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/BMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogene-sis. It is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,and insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thusderepression of the CLOCK complex [ 28]. This provides one pathway that com-\nmunicates metabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, whichactivates a downstream G protein Gsand increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [ 29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thustemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [ 30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn\n2+ﬁnger tran-\nscription factor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven byintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [ 31].\n21.3.2 NAD+Sensing Pathways\nNAD+levels ﬂuctuate with metabolic state.

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA. Functionally active ROR-REVERB-response elements (RREs) are also448 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Given the Reverb is strongly circadianly expressed, rhythmicrepressive action of NCoR/HDAC3-REVERB exerts circadian regulation oftissue-speciﬁc outputs that are independent of ROR regulation [ 46].\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear\nreceptors that function as transcription factors for numerous target genes, especiallythose encoding enzymes important for metabolic pathways. All three PPARisoforms are expressed in a circadian manner in mouse tissue, and PPAR αand\nPPAR γare direct regulators of core clock components, Bmal1 and Reverb α.\nConversely, PPAR αis also a direct Bmal1 target gene. PPAR lipid regulators\ncontinue to express with daily rhythms even when clock-disrupted mice are subjectto daily eating-fasting rhythms [ 47,48]. This data implicates rhythmic PPAR\nexpression is supported by both the circadian clock and the feeding-fasting cycle.\n21.4 Health Implications of Circadian Disruption\nIn the last century, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in modernsocieties have shifted from infectious diseases to noninfectious chronic diseasesincluding hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer,and diseases of chronic inﬂammation [ 49]. Chronic disruption of circadian rhythm\nin experimental animals or as commonly experienced among shift workers raisesthe risk for many of these diseases. These correlative observations have catalyzed arapidly expanding research into understanding the mechanism underlying theconnection between circadian disruption and chronic diseases. We will discuss a\nfew examples here and encourage the readers to explore these connections in\nseveral recently published excellent reviews [ 23,41,47,50,51].\n21.4.1 Genetic Perturbations\nGenetic perturbation of circadian oscillator in mice predisposes to metabolic\npathologies. Such genetic perturbation models have been invaluable in understand-ing the mechanistic link between the circadian clock proteins and metabolic\nhomeostasis. A comprehensive summary of metabolic diseases in circadian pertur-\nbation mouse models has been published recently [ 51]. Here we will cite a few\nexamples. The simultaneous inactivation of Cry1 and Cry2 results in hyperglyce-mia [ 52], while liver-speciﬁc BMAL1 knockout mice show hypoglycemia\n[25]. Altered glucose homeostasis is a hallmark of insulin resistance and type\n2 diabetes.

            "originalText": "the cell­ autonomous molecular circadian clock in mam­\nmals consists of interlocking TTFLs (Fig.  3). In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78. The biological \nfunction of another recently identified CLOCK–BMAL1 \nrepressor, PASD1, appears to be the damp",

Therefore, besides the established diag-nostic method, many studies have been conducted to inves-tigate the potential metrics for PD, translating these intoclinically practical tools for the diagnosis and treatment ofpatients with PD.\nThe unique features of the retina make it a useful\nassessment tool for various systemic diseases. First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Second, due to a common embryonicorigin, the brain and retina share many biological featuresthatplayaprominentroleinthepathogenesisofmajorneu-rodegenerative diseases, including PD.\n8-18Recent studies\nhave reported that PD progression is associated with thestructural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and sug-gest the potential role of the retina as a modality for assess-ing PD progression.\n16-21Recently, deep learning algorithms\nhave been used in several medical fields. Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD. Moreover, heat maps were evaluated inthe macular area to confirm the anatomic association of ouralgorithm’s function. Furthermore, external validation forthe assessment function of this algorithm was conductedusing 2 independent hospital data sets to test the functionof our algorithm in different clinical settings.Methods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThisdecisionanalyticalmodel,conductedfromMay1toSep-tember 30, 2021, adheres to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki.

            "originalText": "Nature Chemistry\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-023-01383-yCy5-amine, showed similar behaviour. These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",
