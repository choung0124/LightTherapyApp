(A)Representative images from the hippocampus of 8-month-old (mo) B6129SF2/J wild type (WT)\nand 3xTg mice. A bplaques are stained with Amylo-Glo (green), phosphorylated tau is stained with AT180 (red), and nuclei are stained with Sytox-DR.\nScale bars = 100 mm.(B)Representative double-plotted actograms of 8 mo WT and 3xTg mice subjected to a 6 h phase advance. Light and dark\nphases of the LD cycle are represented by white and gray background, respectively. (C)Group analysis of activity onset in 8 mo mice, with gray\nrepresenting darkness as in panel (B). Mixed model with Sidak post hoc comparison, n= 7–11. (D)Time to 50% of total phase shift (PS 50) in 8 mo\nmice from panel (C),n= 7–11. (E)Free-running period (averaged over 7 days) in 8 mo mice maintained in constant darkness. (F)Percent of running\nperformed during the dark phase and (G)total distance run in 24 h (averaged over two 24 h periods) in 8 mo mice, n= 7–11.

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.
