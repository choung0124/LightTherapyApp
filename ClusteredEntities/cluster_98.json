In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78.

Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78. The biological \nfunction of another recently identified CLOCK–BMAL1 \nrepressor, PASD1, appears to be the damp",

            "originalText": "expression of the bHLH transcription factor and onco­\nprotein MYC attenuates circadian cycling through down ­\nregulation of BMAL1, although the exact mechanism  \nremains to be clarified221,222.\nThird, cell­ type­specific variations in genome topol­\nogy and chromatin accessibility can contribute to the expression of unique sets of clock output genes in dif­ferent organs. For example, liver ­ specific chromatin \nloops mediate the recruitment of clock­ bound distal \nenhancers to relevant promoters\n200. Although CLOCK–\nBMAL1 have been proposed to function as pioneer ­ like \ntranscription factors, which promote DNA accessibility through nucleosome removal, more recent data suggest that BMAL1 rather binds to already­ accessible DNA \nsites, thereby conceivably increasing their exposure \nto other transcription factors\n223– 225. Although exactly \nhow BMAL1 is recruited to genomic target regions remains to be clarified, the very limited overlap between \nthe BMAL1 cistromes in different tissues suggests a role for cell­ type ­specific transcription regulators in \nthis process.\nThe size of the tissue­ specific circadian transcriptome \ncan be greatly amplified through an intermediate layer of differentially expressed transcription regulators, which are directly controlled by the core molecular clock and in \nturn mediate the circadian expression of further down­\nstream targets. Examples of this include the PARbZip transcription factors DBP , TEF and HLF, which show different expression patterns in the SCN as well as many \nperipheral tissues\n70,226,227. The PARbZip proteins are \ndirect transcriptional targets of CLOCK–BMAL1 while controlling the rhythmic expression of genes containing \nD­ box elements in their regulatory regions. At least in \nthe liver, PARbZip targets include many major detoxi­fication enzymes, thereby illustrating the importance of \ncircadian considerations in drug metabolism\n228.\nLast, it should be noted that despite an overall shared \nmolecular clock identity throughout the body, some \ntissue­ specific adaptations to the canonical molecu­\nlar clock do exist. For example, alternative forms of CLOCK–BMAL1 inhibition — through hepatocyte \nnuclear factor 4A and PASD1 — have been described \nin liver and intestinal cells and in germline tissue, respectively\n79,229.\nEntrainment of circadian clocks\nCentral and peripheral clocks are aligned with the phase of external zeitgebers through entrainment. Zeitgebers \ninclude light, temperature, food, exercise and mechano­\nsensory stimulation, and entrain circadian rhythms by acting either on the central pacemaker or directly in peripheral tissues.\nClock entrainment in D. melanogaster\nOverall, entrainment of peripheral oscillators in insects is less dependent on a master pacemaker compared \nwith mammals, by virtue of their direct responsiveness \nto external zeitgebers such as light and temperature\n230. \nThe sensitivity of the circadian clock to a zeitgeber varies \nwith the phase during which it is applied, as described in \nso­ called phase­ response curves. When different groups \nof flies are exposed to 15­min light pulses at different zeitgeber times, a phase shift in the circadian locomotion \nwith respect to the original phase is observed at times of \nincreased sensitivity, such as after dusk and before dawn, but not during ‘dead zones’ , when light has no effect on the circadian phase\n231,232. In general, a light pulse at the \nbeginning of the night results in a phase delay due to \nthe transient degradation of cytoplasmic TIM, whereas a \nlight pulse in the early morning leads to phase advances owing to nuclear TIM degradation. A light pulse dur ­\ning the day has no impact on phase resetting, as during \nthis ‘dead zone’ TIM levels are too low to be affected by  \nlight­ induced degradation.\nThe D. melanogaster photoreceptor CRY , which is a \nflavoprotein similar to DNA photolyases\n233, is expressed \nin most clock­ containing tissues. Upon excitation with \nlight at a wavelength of 450 nm (the most potent zeit­\ngeber in D. melanogaster160, 234 and in mammals235),  \nCRY binds to TIM18, leading to recruitment of the \nE3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag19 and rapid degradation of \nboth CRY and TIM19,236 (Fig.  1), thereby resetting the \nclock231,237,",

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].  Physiologically, two mechanisms are responsible for sleep-wake patterns: the sleep-wake-dependent homeostatic processes and the circadian rhythms. Homeostatic p r e s s u r e  t o  i n i t i a t e  a n d  maintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness [123, 124]. In addition to the homeostatic issue, determination of the sleep/wake cycle periodicity is characterized by the circadian timing system, e v e n  i n  t h e  absence o f  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  c u e s  [ 1 2 4 ] .  The harmony between homeostatic processes and circadian timing system form the typical pattern of sleep and wakefulness in adults under normal conditions, consisting of approximately 16 hours of constant wakefulness during the d a y  a n d  8  h o u r s  o f  c o n s o l i d a t e d  sleep at night, although sleep needs may change along with the course of life [123, 124]. In humans, multiple sleep/wake cycles are observed during the day and nighttime until the fourth month of age, then, daytime sleep progressively decreases, and by five years of age, the biphasic sleep/wake cycle is fully established [125, 126]. The normal sleep/wake rhythms seem to be crucial for appropriate cognitive development in children. Transient or permanent sleep ",
