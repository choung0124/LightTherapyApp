As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005).

Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005).

The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions.

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

            "originalText": "). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype. Microglia are\nheavily implicated in AD pathophysiology and microglia activation\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org",

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
