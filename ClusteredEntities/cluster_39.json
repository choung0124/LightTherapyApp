The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020). Besides\nthis, there is an essential role of circadian rhythm in*Corresponding author: Monojit Debnath , Department of Human\nGenetics, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India,E-mail: monozeet@gmail.com\nFazal Abdul and Nikhitha Sreenivas, Department of Human Genetics,\nNational Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road,Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India\nJohn Vijay Sagar Kommu, Department of Child and Adolescent\nPsychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India\nMoinak Banerjee, Human Molecular Genetics Division, Rajiv Gandhi\nCentre for Biotechnology, Thycaud Post, Poojappura, Trivandrum,695014, Kerala, IndiaMichael Berk, School of Medicine, IMPACT Strategic Research Centre,\nDeakin University, Barwon Health, PO Box 281, Geelong, Victoria,\n3220, Australia; and Orygen, The Centre of Excellence in Youth MentalHealth, The Department of Psychiatry, The Florey Institute of\nNeuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, 30\nRoyal Parade, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, AustraliaMichael Maes, School of Medicine, IMPACT Strategic Research Centre,\nDeakin University, Barwon Health, PO Box 281, Geelong, Victoria,\n3220, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, KingChulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Pathum Wan, Pathum Wan District,\nBangkok, 10330, Thailand; and Department of Psychiatry, Medical\nUniversity of Plovdiv, bul. “V",

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56]. Complex inter-actions between clock genes polymorphism or reduced expression and other biological factors, including the volume and malfunction of pineal gland [ 1 4 2 , 1 4 3 ] ,  m u t a t i o n s  o r  r e d u c e d  e x p r e s s i o",

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

            "originalText": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00    5 disorders are among the most common medical complaints in soci-ety and have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behav-ior [20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, a n d  q u a l i t y  o f  l i f e  [ 1 1 3 ,  128].  The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56]. Complex inter-actions between clock genes polymorphism or reduced expression and other biological factors, including the volume and malfunction of pineal gland [ 1 4 2 , 1 4 3 ] ,  m u t a t i o n s  o r  r e d u c e d  e x p r e s s i o",
