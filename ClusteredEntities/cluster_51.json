The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020). Besides\nthis, there is an essential role of circadian rhythm in*Corresponding author: Monojit Debnath , Department of Human\nGenetics, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India,E-mail: monozeet@gmail.com\nFazal Abdul and Nikhitha Sreenivas, Department of Human Genetics,\nNational Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road,Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India\nJohn Vijay Sagar Kommu, Department of Child and Adolescent\nPsychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences,Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, Karnataka, India\nMoinak Banerjee, Human Molecular Genetics Division, Rajiv Gandhi\nCentre for Biotechnology, Thycaud Post, Poojappura, Trivandrum,695014, Kerala, IndiaMichael Berk, School of Medicine, IMPACT Strategic Research Centre,\nDeakin University, Barwon Health, PO Box 281, Geelong, Victoria,\n3220, Australia; and Orygen, The Centre of Excellence in Youth MentalHealth, The Department of Psychiatry, The Florey Institute of\nNeuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, 30\nRoyal Parade, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, AustraliaMichael Maes, School of Medicine, IMPACT Strategic Research Centre,\nDeakin University, Barwon Health, PO Box 281, Geelong, Victoria,\n3220, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, KingChulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Pathum Wan, Pathum Wan District,\nBangkok, 10330, Thailand; and Department of Psychiatry, Medical\nUniversity of Plovdiv, bul. “V",

The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020).

In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6).

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.
