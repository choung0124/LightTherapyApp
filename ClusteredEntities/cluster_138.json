            "originalText": "in the development and function of the nervous system\n(Nguyen et al. 2018; Olde Loohuis et al. 2012). miRNAs have\nemerged as key elements in circadian clock regulation in\nrecent times. Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well",

Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathol-\nogies, including cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021). Melatonin supplementation\nhas shown promising results in treating sleep onset\ninsomnia in children with ASD (Malow et al. 2012, 2021).10\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",
