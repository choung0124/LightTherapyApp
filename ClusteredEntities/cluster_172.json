Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
