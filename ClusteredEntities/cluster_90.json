These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above.

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease.

Sleep tim­\ning and duration are highly sensitive to the internal \nand external state of the animal, which is controlled by \nthe coordinated action of neuronal and glial circuits, including the central pacemaker, intracellular factors, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and can be \ninfluenced by the immune system and metabolism \n(reviewed in\n170). Clock ­ less flies can have normal total \namounts of sleep, despite it being randomly distributed \nacross day and night171. Conversely, sleep mutant flies \ncan exhibit normal rhythmicity despite overall reduced sleep\n172– 174. Nevertheless, separating the two processes \ngenetically can be complicated owing to some genes having roles in both processes, as a substantial pro ­\nportion of flies in some sleep mutant populations also \nappear to be arrhythmic\n172– 174. For example, the sleep \ngene encoding Wide awake, whose disruption reduces \nthe duration of daily sleep, is expressed in and affects  \nclock neurons in a circadian manner, thereby showing \nthe interconnectedness of mechanisms controlling sleep and circadian rhythms\n175. Reciprocally, various manipu­\nlations of circadian genes and neurons have an effect on \nsleep176. Notably, mutants of the clock gene cyc  display \nreduced rebound sleep after sleep deprivation177,178. Like \nmammals, hungry D. melanogaster sleep poorly; this starvation­ induced sleep deprivation is mediated by \nclk and cyc , pointing towards regulatory integration of \ntwo homeostatic behaviours — feeding and sleep — by \nthe circadian clock\n179. The DN1 subset of clock neu­\nrons regulates both wake and sleep at different times of \nthe day180, 181, and recent work showed that these neu­\nrons also integrate temperature to regulate the timing of sleep\n182.\nThe circadian clock also regulates mating by influ­\nencing the production of sex pheromones in secretory \ncells called oenocytes. The oenocyte clock functions cell­ autonomously; however, the neuropeptide PDF, \nwhich is released by master clock neurons in the central \nbrain, is required to set the correct phase of the oeno­\ncyte clock and thereby of sex hormone production\n183. \nMemory formation is an example of a neuronal process \nthat, although being located in the brain, is downstream \nand therefore, by our definition, peripheral to the central clock. Similar to what was described for honeybees at the beginning of the twentieth century\n184, flies remember a \nspecific odour stimulus learned at a certain time of day, \nand reproduce the correct stimulus–time pair the next \nday. In this form of appetitive learning, a functioning cir ­\ncadian clock is only needed to encode time­ of­day infor ­\nmation, not for memory formation per se: clock­ less \nD. melanogaster are still able to learn a specific stimulus, but time­ of­day information is lost\n185. A novel addition \nto the list of processes and organs regulated by the clock \nis the blood–brain barrier. A recent study showed that \nD. melanogaster  perineurial glia, which form the out­\nermost layer of the brain, need a functioning clock to modulate diurnal oscillations of a xenobiotic transporter, \nwhich prevents import of toxic substances into the brain \nin a time­ of­day­ dependent manner\n186.Peripheral clocks in mammals\nThe discovery of circadian rhythms in cultured fibro­blast cell lines some 20 years ago led to the realization \nthat, contrary to long­ standing belief, the molecular \nclock of mammals operates not just in the SCN, but \nin virtually all the tissues and cells of the body\n187, 188. \nTo date, peripheral clocks have been described in the \nliver, lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscles, adipose tis­\nsue and many other tissues (Fig.  5). A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191.

This parameter\nindicates the lipophilicity of the MJH to the lipid bilayers.[40,41]\nThe higher the value the more likely the MJH will bind to the\nlipid bilayers.

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

When it was not possible to measure the height, \nbecause the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm3), the tumour \nvolume was calculated as (1/2) × length × width2.\nPreparation of fresh solutions of Cy7.5-amine and DMSO for \nin vivo studies\nOn the day of treatment, a fresh solution of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine was \nprepared by diluting the 8 mM Cy7.5-amine stock in DMSO in PBS \nbuffer; the final dilution contained 2.5% DMSO. A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3. The volume of the tumours was calculated as (1/2) × len\ngth × width × height. When it was not possible to measure the height, because the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm\n3), the tumour \n",
