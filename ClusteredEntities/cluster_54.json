These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm.

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm.
