(B)  Light -\ninduced masking of activity in \nWT mice e xposed to either the \nshort λ  or long λ  enriched light \nfor one hour at ZT 14. The activity level during this light exposure was compared to that during the equivalent hour (ZT 14-15) on the day before the \ntreatment (baseline activity).

After entrainment to the standard light:dark (LD) cycle, WT mice were placed into constant \ndarkness (DD) for 10 days and \nthen exposed to either short λ  \nor long λ  enriched illumination (10 lx, 15 min) at CT 16 (4 hours after the activity onset).
