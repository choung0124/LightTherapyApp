            "originalText": "variants of the clock genes are signi ﬁcantly associated with\nthe chronotype, like morningness (Jones et al. 2016). There\nis an association of genetic or polymorphic variants of\ncircadian genes with a range of neuropsychiatric, meta-\nbolic, malignant, and cardiovascular disorders (Jagannath\net al. 2017). A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications inneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nu-\ncleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.Studies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCN also modi ﬁed\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This sug-\ngested that the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as thecircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCN were cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmarkstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmit-\nters profoundly in ﬂuence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for re ﬁning circadian output\nrhythm in mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as theperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behav-\nioral that entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astro-cytes can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to im-pairments in learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010). More importantly, a recent study on mice has\nestablished that BMAL1 deletion and its reduced expres-\nsion promoted neuronal cell death by regulating neuronal\nredox homeostasis; implying a critical role of impaired\nTable :Mammalian genes regulating circadian rhythm and the effect of their mutations.\nGenes Functions Effect of mutations\nCLOCK It is a transcription factor.

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

            "originalText": "the cell­ autonomous molecular circadian clock in mam­\nmals consists of interlocking TTFLs (Fig.  3). In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78.

REV ­ ERBα degradation medi­\nated by another E3 ligase, SIAH2, affects the circadian \nperiod length, whereas its degradation by the E3 ubiquitin \nligase FBXW7 following CDK1 ­mediated phosphoryla ­\ntion controls circadian amplitude, meaning the difference between the peak and trough values of the oscillation\n129,130.\nThe negative elements of the core molecular clock \nassemble into large multi­ protein complexes that contain \nall three PER proteins, both CRY proteins and CK1δ, into which CLOCK and BMAL1 are incorporated in the nucleus\n131. When purified from liver nuclear extracts, all \nof these proteins appear to be part of the same 1.9­MDa \ncomplex. However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

            "originalText": "One of the most apparent outputs of the circadian \nclock is the sleep–wake cycle. Timing of sleep is deter ­\nmined by two factors: the need to sleep — also called \nsleep pressure — and the circadian clock169. Sleep tim­\ning and duration are highly sensitive to the internal \nand external state of the animal, which is controlled by \nthe coordinated action of neuronal and glial circuits, including the central pacemaker, intracellular factors, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and can be \ninfluenced by the immune system and metabolism \n(reviewed in\n170). Clock ­ less flies can have normal total \namounts of sleep, despite it being randomly distributed \nacross day and night171. Conversely, sleep mutant flies \ncan exhibit normal rhythmicity despite overall reduced sleep\n172– 174. Nevertheless, separating the two processes \ngenetically can be complicated owing to some genes having roles in both processes, as a substantial pro ­\nportion of flies in some sleep mutant populations also \nappear to be arrhythmic\n172– 174. For example, the sleep \ngene encoding Wide awake, whose disruption reduces \nthe duration of daily sleep, is expressed in and affects  \nclock neurons in a circadian manner, thereby showing \nthe interconnectedness of mechanisms controlling sleep and circadian rhythms\n175. Reciprocally, various manipu­\nlations of circadian genes and neurons have an effect on \nsleep176. Notably, mutants of the clock gene cyc  display \nreduced rebound sleep after sleep deprivation177,178. Like \nmammals, hungry D. melanogaster sleep poorly; this starvation­ induced sleep deprivation is mediated by \nclk and cyc , pointing towards regulatory integration of \ntwo homeostatic behaviours — feeding and sleep — by \nthe circadian clock\n179. The DN1 subset of clock neu­\nrons regulates both wake and sleep at different times of \nthe day180, 181, and recent work showed that these neu­\nrons also integrate temperature to regulate the timing of sleep\n182.\nThe circadian clock also regulates mating by influ­\nencing the production of sex pheromones in secretory \ncells called oenocytes. The oenocyte clock functions cell­ autonomously; however, the neuropeptide PDF, \nwhich is released by master clock neurons in the central \nbrain, is required to set the correct phase of the oeno­\ncyte clock and thereby of sex hormone production\n183. \nMemory formation is an example of a neuronal process \nthat, although being located in the brain, is downstream \nand therefore, by our definition, peripheral to the central clock. Similar to what was described for honeybees at the beginning of the twentieth century\n184, flies remember a \nspecific odour stimulus learned at a certain time of day, \nand reproduce the correct stimulus–time pair the next \nday. In this form of appetitive learning, a functioning cir ­\ncadian clock is only needed to encode time­ of­day infor ­\nmation, not for memory formation per se: clock­ less \nD. melanogaster are still able to learn a specific stimulus, but time­ of­day information is lost\n185. A novel addition \nto the list of processes and organs regulated by the clock \nis the blood–brain barrier. A recent study showed that \nD. melanogaster  perineurial glia, which form the out­\nermost layer of the brain, need a functioning clock to modulate diurnal oscillations of a xenobiotic transporter, \nwhich prevents import of toxic substances into the brain \nin a time­ of­day­ dependent manner\n186.Peripheral clocks in mammals\nThe discovery of circadian rhythms in cultured fibro­blast cell lines some 20 years ago led to the realization \nthat, contrary to long­ standing belief, the molecular \nclock of mammals operates not just in the SCN, but \nin virtually all the tissues and cells of the body\n187, 188. \nTo date, peripheral clocks have been described in the \nliver, lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscles, adipose tis­\nsue and many other tissues (Fig.  5).

Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated.

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

            "originalText": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00    5 disorders are among the most common medical complaints in soci-ety and have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behav-ior [20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, a n d  q u a l i t y  o f  l i f e  [ 1 1 3 ,  128].  The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.
