As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

            "originalText": " they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ).

This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15.

As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

            "originalText": " they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",
