However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

Their locomotor activity was recorded per 3 -\nmin interval  and monitored to ensure the entrainment to the housing LD cycles. The animals \nwere subjected to one hour of light ( enriched for long or short wavelengths) at ZT 14. The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).

            "originalText": "the period length is controlled. We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",

Total running distance and preference for\nrunning in the dark were measured after all mice had completely\nre-entrained after a phase shift and were averaged across 2 days.\nTo determine free running period, after all mice had completely re-\nentrained they were switched to DD and period was calculated from\nthe onset of activity across 7 days.\nIn masking trials, light intensity was decreased by wrapping\nﬂuorescent lights in neutral density ﬁlter ﬁlms and measured witha spectrometer (Sekonic Spectrometer C-800). Illuminance was\nmeasured in lux, and photon ﬂux, summed from 380 to 780 nm,\nwas calculated using formulas in the supplementary materials in\nLucas et al. (2014). A 1hr light pulse was delivered from ZT13-\n14. Percent running in light was calculated by comparing to the\nactivity measured during the same period of constant darkness on\nthe preceding day for each mouse.

Four MJH were evaluated (BL-204, GL-308-2,\nBL-141-2 and BL-142) in two independent experiments ( n=2).\nTheresultsfurthersuggestthatthephotochemicalreactionsare\nlesslikelyresponsiblefortherapidpermeabilizationofcellmem-\nbranes within 10 min or less.

This eﬀect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the elec-\ntron density along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlengthofthepolymethinebridgeinﬂuencestheplasmonicityand\ntherebythevibroniceﬀecttopermeabilizecells(Figure S18,Sup-\nporting Information).

The weak TMP resonance is observed in the UV–vis spec-\ntrum of Cy7-amine at ≈380 nm in Figure S14(Supporting In-\nformation) and Cy5-amine at ≈320 nm in Figure S15(Support-\ning Information). 4) Substitution of the indole by other alterna-\ntive resonance structures, such as 1-methylquinoline, weakens\nthe plasmonicity and the VDA activity (Figure S20, Supporting\nInformation).

For exam-\nple,fromFigure S42(SupportingInformation)weidentiﬁedthat\nthecarboxylatedGL-261-2waslesstoxicthantheaminocyanines.\nFollowingthisobservation,wesynthesizedBL-242(Figure S43E,\nSupportingInformation).Theacetylationoftheaminesuchasin\nGL-362-2 enhanced the toxicity (Figure S43E, Supporting Infor-\nmation).Overall,nodirectcorrelationbetweenthelight-activatedVDAactivity,andtheinherenttoxicitywasobserved(Figure S43A\nvs FigureS43B, Supporting Information). The ratio of inherent\ntoxicity/VDA activity was deﬁned to identify the lead molecule\nwiththehighesttherapeuticindexofVDAactivityversusinher-\nenttoxicity(Figure S43C,SupportingInformation).Speciﬁcally,\nthe therapeutic index was deﬁned as the ratio of Tox LC50/VDA\nLC50.BL-141-2hasaconvenienthightherapeuticindexof22and\nav e r yl o wV D AL C50=18 nm to eradicate 50% of the cells and\nVDA LC100=40 nm to eradicate 100% of the cells. GL-261-2 is\nthe lead molecule with the highest therapeutic index of 62 and\naV D AL C50=80 nm (Figure S43D, Supporting Information).\nGL-261-2, with a therapeutic index of ≈60, is a plasmon-driven\nMJH candidate for translation to rodent studies, which is safer\nthan Cy7.5-amine (therapeutic index of ≈2–5 depending on the\nmethod used) that was successfully applied in vivo to eradicate\nmelanomatumorswithoutsignsoftoxicsideeﬀectsinmice.[23]\n3.Conclusion\nA library of 23 NIR 730 nm light-activated MJH displaying\nplasmon-driven vibrational action was designed and synthe-\nsized (Figures 1,2). This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH.

In the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged car-\ndiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the ﬂow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information).

( a) Important MJH structural elements. LMP \n= longitudinal molecular plasmon. TMP = transversal molecular plasmon. The strength of the molecular plasmon (VDA) is expected to be proportional to \nthe length of the π-conjugation. The π-conjugation can be increased in two \nways: 1) increasing the length of polymethine bridge and 2) increasing the size of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fused to the indole. The purple color is to highlight the polymethine bridge. The cyanines are named by the number of carbons in the polymethine bridge, in the example it is C7. The red color is to highlight the structure of the indole, and the orange color is for the benzoindole. The heptamethine bridge (C7) can be chemically conjugated with indole to form Cy7 or with benzoindole to form Cy7.5. These structural elements, polymethine and indole or benzoindole, hybridize to from a coupled system with the molecular plasmon-dominated longitudinally by the polymethine bridge \n(LMP in purple) and transversally by the indole or benzoindole (TMP in teal). \nHowever, these structures are hybridized and the electronic conjugation of the benzoindole influences the polymethine bridge and vice versa.
