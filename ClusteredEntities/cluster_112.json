A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191. There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",
