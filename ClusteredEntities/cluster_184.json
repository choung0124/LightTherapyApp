From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example.

Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect.
