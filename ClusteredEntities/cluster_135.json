Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.  Keywords: Autism, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, clock genes, suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin. 1. INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner.

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.
