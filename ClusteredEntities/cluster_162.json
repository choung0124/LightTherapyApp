The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA.

A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream.

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference.

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference. Effect sizes were interpreted as small (d = 0.2), medium ",
