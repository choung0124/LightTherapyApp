In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015).

These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models.

In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010).

We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype.

PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001).

To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ).

PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
