ROS \nscavengers do not retard the permeabilization of A375 cells to DAPI when treated with 2 μM Cy7.5-amine under illumination with 730 nm NIR light (80 mW cm\n−2 \nfor 10 min). (a ) Effect of 10 mM NAC (N -acetylcysteine). The exact p values \nobtained were 0.0004, 0.0005, 0.0969 and 0.6005 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (b ) Effect of 100 mM TU \n(thiourea). The exact p values obtained were 0.9071, 0.8021, 0.4631, and 0.5918 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (c) Effect of 2.5 mM SA (sodium azide). The exact p values obtained were 0.3712, \n0.2751, 0.4267, and 1.0 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (d ) Effect of ROS scavengers at variable irradiation time of \n730 nm NIR light at 80 mW cm\n−2. Five different scavengers were used: TU 100 mM, azide 2.5 mM, NAC 1 mM, Vit C (vitamin C) 5 mM and Met (methionine) 5 mM. DMSO control contains 0.1% DMSO in the media because DMSO is used to pre-solubilize the Cy7.5-amine stock solution at 2 mM and diluted to 1:1000 to obtain \n2 μM Cy7.5-amine in media containing 0.1% DMSO. Experimental groups are: \nDMSO = 0.1% DMSO, DMSO + L = 0.1 % DMSO + NIR light treatment, Cy7.5 = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine and Cy7.5 + L = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine + NIR light treatment. In all the plots 3 independent samples were processed and analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 3). In all plots data are presented as mean values ± SD, respectively. t -test, \ntwo-tail, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 Statistical significance p < 0.05, ns = not significant.
