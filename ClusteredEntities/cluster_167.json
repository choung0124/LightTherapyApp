            "originalText": "etric vibration rather than a collection of single \nvibrations9. This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of elec -\ntronic and vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone \nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The \nshoulder (λ  ≈ 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corre -\nsponds to this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective \nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecu -\nlar plasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent \ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules \ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal \nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The \nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation) \nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of \nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading \nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary \nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting the vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1 \nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in \nSupplementary Videos 2–4, respectively, obtained from first-principles \nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm calculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density \nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT), \nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at \n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short lon -\ngitudinal charge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with \ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended \nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations \ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of \nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions \nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400–600 nm) are inac -\ncurately overestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm−1 \n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 × 1013 s−1) \nfor 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethyl-4,4′,5,5′-dibenzo-2,2′-indotricarbocyanine \nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy \nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the \nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18. \nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption \nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode, \nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm−1 corresponds to \nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 ",

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3).

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors.

The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13].

            "originalText": "accomplished via rhythmic expression of genes encoding regulators and enzymes\nof important metabolic pathways. The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence.

As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions[1], and 35 % suffer from metabolic syndrome [ 2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the ﬁve metabolic risk factors: largewaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, andhigh fasting glucose [ 3]. As of now, 60 % of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80 % of prema-ture stroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [ 4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependentrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increas-ingly apparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in bothprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm infeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly dur-\ning the daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovas-\ncular diseases and other metabolic complications [ 5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence.

            "originalText": " rhythm of ASD individuals, the actigraphy, which measures activity patterns via wristwatch-like devices that contain miniature accelerometers, may be useful for monitor along with several continuous days to accurately assess sleep patterns in children [26]. The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5. MELATONIN RHYTHM IN ASD  Among circadian disruptions in ASD, the diurnal rhythm of cortisol is altered in individuals with ASD, w h i c h  p r e s e n t  e le-vated cortisol in the evening [154].

This individual, however, was awake prior  to the onset of the flash \nsequence. Examination of the other six individual hypnograms did not indicate any substantive W during the \nflash sequence (Figure S1).\nA reverse power analysis, with alpha set to 0.05 and power to 0.80, indicates that given the observed 3.2-min \nstandard deviation in change in total wake duration during the 1-h stimulus (excluding the participant that was \nalready awake at the time of the flashes, Fig.  2), we could have detected a 4.8-min difference in the amount of \nwake.

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference. Effect sizes were interpreted as small (d = 0.2), medium ",

Inspection of individual hypnograms indicated \nthat one individual had substantially more wake during exposure to the flash sequence (51 min) as compared \nto the control condition (1 min, Figure S1). This individual, however, was awake prior  to the onset of the flash \nsequence. Examination of the other six individual hypnograms did not indicate any substantive W during the \nflash sequence (Figure S1).\nA reverse power analysis, with alpha set to 0.05 and power to 0.80, indicates that given the observed 3.2-min \nstandard deviation in change in total wake duration during the 1-h stimulus (excluding the participant that was \nalready awake at the time of the flashes, Fig.  2), we could have detected a 4.8-min difference in the amount of \nwake. This suggests that if the flash exposure were to have induced an increase in wake, it would not be greater \nthan 4.8 min.\nFigure 1.  Circadian phase shift (Δϕ ).

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference. Effect sizes were interpreted as small (d = 0.2), medium ",
