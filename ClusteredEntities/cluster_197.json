Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

            "originalText": "the period length is controlled. We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",

            "originalText": "the cell­ autonomous molecular circadian clock in mam­\nmals consists of interlocking TTFLs (Fig.  3). In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78. The biological \nfunction of another recently identified CLOCK–BMAL1 \nrepressor, PASD1, appears to be the damp",

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.
