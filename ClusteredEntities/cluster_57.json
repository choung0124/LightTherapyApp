            "originalText": "One of the most apparent outputs of the circadian \nclock is the sleep–wake cycle. Timing of sleep is deter ­\nmined by two factors: the need to sleep — also called \nsleep pressure — and the circadian clock169. Sleep tim­\ning and duration are highly sensitive to the internal \nand external state of the animal, which is controlled by \nthe coordinated action of neuronal and glial circuits, including the central pacemaker, intracellular factors, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and can be \ninfluenced by the immune system and metabolism \n(reviewed in\n170). Clock ­ less flies can have normal total \namounts of sleep, despite it being randomly distributed \nacross day and night171. Conversely, sleep mutant flies \ncan exhibit normal rhythmicity despite overall reduced sleep\n172– 174. Nevertheless, separating the two processes \ngenetically can be complicated owing to some genes having roles in both processes, as a substantial pro ­\nportion of flies in some sleep mutant populations also \nappear to be arrhythmic\n172– 174. For example, the sleep \ngene encoding Wide awake, whose disruption reduces \nthe duration of daily sleep, is expressed in and affects  \nclock neurons in a circadian manner, thereby showing \nthe interconnectedness of mechanisms controlling sleep and circadian rhythms\n175. Reciprocally, various manipu­\nlations of circadian genes and neurons have an effect on \nsleep176. Notably, mutants of the clock gene cyc  display \nreduced rebound sleep after sleep deprivation177,178. Like \nmammals, hungry D. melanogaster sleep poorly; this starvation­ induced sleep deprivation is mediated by \nclk and cyc , pointing towards regulatory integration of \ntwo homeostatic behaviours — feeding and sleep — by \nthe circadian clock\n179. The DN1 subset of clock neu­\nrons regulates both wake and sleep at different times of \nthe day180, 181, and recent work showed that these neu­\nrons also integrate temperature to regulate the timing of sleep\n182.\nThe circadian clock also regulates mating by influ­\nencing the production of sex pheromones in secretory \ncells called oenocytes. The oenocyte clock functions cell­ autonomously; however, the neuropeptide PDF, \nwhich is released by master clock neurons in the central \nbrain, is required to set the correct phase of the oeno­\ncyte clock and thereby of sex hormone production\n183. \nMemory formation is an example of a neuronal process \nthat, although being located in the brain, is downstream \nand therefore, by our definition, peripheral to the central clock. Similar to what was described for honeybees at the beginning of the twentieth century\n184, flies remember a \nspecific odour stimulus learned at a certain time of day, \nand reproduce the correct stimulus–time pair the next \nday. In this form of appetitive learning, a functioning cir ­\ncadian clock is only needed to encode time­ of­day infor ­\nmation, not for memory formation per se: clock­ less \nD. melanogaster are still able to learn a specific stimulus, but time­ of­day information is lost\n185. A novel addition \nto the list of processes and organs regulated by the clock \nis the blood–brain barrier. A recent study showed that \nD. melanogaster  perineurial glia, which form the out­\nermost layer of the brain, need a functioning clock to modulate diurnal oscillations of a xenobiotic transporter, \nwhich prevents import of toxic substances into the brain \nin a time­ of­day­ dependent manner\n186.Peripheral clocks in mammals\nThe discovery of circadian rhythms in cultured fibro­blast cell lines some 20 years ago led to the realization \nthat, contrary to long­ standing belief, the molecular \nclock of mammals operates not just in the SCN, but \nin virtually all the tissues and cells of the body\n187, 188. \nTo date, peripheral clocks have been described in the \nliver, lung, kidney, heart, skeletal muscles, adipose tis­\nsue and many other tissues (Fig.  5). A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191.

There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",
