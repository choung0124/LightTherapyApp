Light and dark\nphases of the LD cycle are represented by white and gray background, respectively. (C)Group analysis of activity onset in 8 mo mice, with gray\nrepresenting darkness as in panel (B).

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79).

Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD.
