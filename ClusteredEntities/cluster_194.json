In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Three molecules were tested: the most VDA ac-\ntiveBL-204,themediumVDAactiveBL-141-2,andthelowVDA\nactive Cy7-amine. The lethal concentration to kill the cell popu-\nlation by 50% (VDA IC50) was found to be 45, 65, and 175 nm,\nrespectively. The lethal concentrations to eradicate 100% of the\ncancer cells were 75, 100, and 500 nm, respectively.

This parameter\nindicates the lipophilicity of the MJH to the lipid bilayers.[40,41]\nThe higher the value the more likely the MJH will bind to the\nlipid bilayers. The protonation state of the MJH strongly inﬂu-\nences the polarity of the molecules and hence the logP values.\nThe logP values were calculated considering the charged state\n(amine protonated or carboxylic acid ionized) of the side chain\n(FigureS31A, Supporting Information) or in the neutral state\n(FigureS31B,SupportingInformation)ifnoionizationwaspre-\nsumed.

            "originalText": "EM media was removed and the cells were washed twice with \nPBS buffer. Then, a mixture of fresh DMEM media without phenol red \nand with the MJH was added to the cells. The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.
