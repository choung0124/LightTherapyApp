A bplaques are stained with Amylo-Glo (green), phosphorylated tau is stained with AT180 (red), and nuclei are stained with Sytox-DR.\nScale bars = 100 mm.(B)Representative double-plotted actograms of 8 mo WT and 3xTg mice subjected to a 6 h phase advance. Light and dark\nphases of the LD cycle are represented by white and gray background, respectively. (C)Group analysis of activity onset in 8 mo mice, with gray\nrepresenting darkness as in panel (B).

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

WT \nand Opn4DTA were kept in \nbaseline conditions (LD) or \nexposed to the short λ  \nenriched DLaN (10 lx)  for \ntwo weeks. ( A) Waveforms \nof daily rhythms in cage \nactivity of WT (left) or Opn4\nDTA mice (right) under \nLD control conditions or \nunder the short λ  enriched \nDLaN. The activity \nwaveform (1 hr bins) of each group was analyzed \nusing a two- way ANOVA \nwith treatment and time as  \nfactors. The WT mice \nexhibited a significant effect of treatment (F\n(1, 239)  = \n95.39; P < 0.001), time \n(F(23, 239)  = 11.674; P < \n0.001) as well as a significant interaction between the two factors \n(F\n(23, 239)  = 3.047, P  < \n0.001).  In contrast, the Opn4\nDTA mice exhibited a \nsignificant effect of time (F\n(23,215)  = 4.73; P  < 0.001) \nbut not treatment (F (1, 215)  = 0.636, P = 0.426). There was not any evidence for an interaction (F (23,215)  = \n0.611; P = 0.917).

(B)  Analyses of the properties of the daily activity rhythms \n(10 day recordings) including power, amplitude, and overall activity levels. (C)  Light -evoked negative \nmasking was measured by exposing the mice to the short λ  enhanced light (10 lx) for 1h at ZT14 and \ncomparing their activity to that of the prior day. (D)  The impact of the short λ  enhanced DLaN on WT and \nOpn4DTA social interactions was measured by comparing the behavior of the mice in baseline conditions \n(LD) and then after 2 weeks exposure to the short λ  enhanced DLaN. A paired t -test was used to analyze \nthe changes before and after light exposure ( Table 2) with  the asterisks indicating significant difference \n(P < 0.05) .
