These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations.

Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

            "originalText": "EM media was removed and the cells were washed twice with \nPBS buffer. Then, a mixture of fresh DMEM media without phenol red \nand with the MJH was added to the cells. The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.
