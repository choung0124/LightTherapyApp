            "originalText": "accomplished via rhythmic expression of genes encoding regulators and enzymes\nof important metabolic pathways. The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

In wild-type mice under nighttime-\nrestricted feeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50 % [ 85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accu-mulation of over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillator-deﬁcient Cry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [ 22]. These results indicate the power-\nful inﬂuence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [ 86,87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metaboliceffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later – even when both groups were con-\ntrolled for total caloric intake and physical activity [ 89]. In an evidence-based\neating time survey, majority of adult non-shift workers were found to spread theirdaily nutrient intake >14 h. A small subset of volunteers, after adopting a 10–11 h\neating schedule, reported sustained weight loss of ~4 % over a year with associatedimprovement in subjective measure of energy level during the day and sleep qualityat night [ 90]. The impact of daily eating-fasting rhythm on health may be pleiotro-\npic. In a retrospective analyses of self-reported 24 h food recall, a correlation\nbetween overnight fasting of /C2113 h and reduction in blood biomarkers of cancer\nrisk has been found [ 91]. This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feeding-\nfasting even under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provideprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolution-ary relevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. Whilethe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to meta-bolic syndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects.
