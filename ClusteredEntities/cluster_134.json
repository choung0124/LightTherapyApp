Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019).

In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016).

            "originalText": "mice under standard conditions, but the shift of consumption to the light phase leads\nto weight gain and glucose intolerance [ 84]. In wild-type mice under nighttime-\nrestricted feeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50 % [ 85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accu-mulation of over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillator-deﬁcient Cry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [ 22]. These results indicate the power-\nful inﬂuence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [ 86,87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metaboliceffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later – even when both groups were con-\ntrolled for total caloric intake and physical activity [ 89]. In an evidence-based\neating time survey, majority of adult non-shift workers were found to spread theirdaily nutrient intake >14 h. A small subset of volunteers, after adopting a 10–11 h\neating schedule, reported sustained weight loss of ~4 % over a year with associatedimprovement in subjective measure of energy level during the day and sleep qualityat night [ 90]. The impact of daily eating-fasting rhythm on health may be pleiotro-\npic. In a retrospective analyses of self-reported 24 h food recall, a correlation\nbetween overnight fasting of /C2113 h and reduction in blood biomarkers of cancer\nrisk has been found [ 91]. This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feeding-\nfasting even under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provideprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolution-ary relevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. Whilethe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to meta-bolic syndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects. The timing of feeding and fasting, irrespective of total caloric intake, canreduce weight gain and improve metabolic parameters. It has been shown that time-21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 453",

In wild-type mice under nighttime-\nrestricted feeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50 % [ 85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accu-mulation of over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillator-deﬁcient Cry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [ 22]. These results indicate the power-\nful inﬂuence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [ 86,87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metaboliceffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later – even when both groups were con-\ntrolled for total caloric intake and physical activity [ 89]. In an evidence-based\neating time survey, majority of adult non-shift workers were found to spread theirdaily nutrient intake >14 h. A small subset of volunteers, after adopting a 10–11 h\neating schedule, reported sustained weight loss of ~4 % over a year with associatedimprovement in subjective measure of energy level during the day and sleep qualityat night [ 90]. The impact of daily eating-fasting rhythm on health may be pleiotro-\npic. In a retrospective analyses of self-reported 24 h food recall, a correlation\nbetween overnight fasting of /C2113 h and reduction in blood biomarkers of cancer\nrisk has been found [ 91]. This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feeding-\nfasting even under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provideprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolution-ary relevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. Whilethe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to meta-bolic syndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects. The timing of feeding and fasting, irrespective of total caloric intake, canreduce weight gain and improve metabolic parameters. It has been shown that time-21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 453",
