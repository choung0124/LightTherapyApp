            "originalText": "etric vibration rather than a collection of single \nvibrations9. This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of elec -\ntronic and vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone \nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The \nshoulder (λ  ≈ 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corre -\nsponds to this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective \nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecu -\nlar plasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent \ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules \ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal \nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The \nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation) \nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of \nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading \nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary \nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting the vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1 \nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in \nSupplementary Videos 2–4, respectively, obtained from first-principles \nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm calculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density \nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT), \nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at \n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short lon -\ngitudinal charge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with \ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended \nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations \ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of \nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions \nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400–600 nm) are inac -\ncurately overestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm−1 \n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 × 1013 s−1) \nfor 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethyl-4,4′,5,5′-dibenzo-2,2′-indotricarbocyanine \nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy \nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the \nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18. \nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption \nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode, \nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm−1 corresponds to \nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 ",

Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

( A) The number of c -\nFos positive cells was \ndetermined bilaterally  in several \nbrain regions including the SCN, the peri -Habenula (pHb), \nthe paraventricular nucleus \n(PVN), the lateral hypothalamus \n(LH) and the basolateral \namygdala (BLA). The values from each region of interest (both left and right hemisphere, two consecutive slices/animal) \nwere averaged to obtain one \nvalue per animal (n=6), and are shown as the mean ± SEM (histograms with the values from the individual animals \noverlaid). Data were analyzed with a two- way ANOVA with \ngenotype and treatment as \nfactors (see Table 6) followed \nby Holm -Sidak multiple comparison test. Significant ( P < 0.05) effects of treatment or genotype are \nindicated with an asterisk or a crosshatch, respectively. ( B) Exposure to the short λ enriched DLaN  for \ntwo weeks activated more glutamatergic neurons in the mutants in comparison to the WT. Representative images of vGlut2- ZsGreen1 neurons immunopositive for c -Fos in the BLA of WT and Cntnap2 KO mice \nheterozygous for vGlut2- ZsGreen1. WT and Cntnap2 KO were perfused at ZT18 and the brains collected. \nThe total number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1 neurons and, among these, of those immunopositive for c -Fos was \ndetermined in 4 to 7 images acquired at random from 6 consecutive slices per animal (n=4). The values \nfrom each image per animal were averaged and analyzed with a two- way ANOVA followed by the Holm -\nSidak multiple comparisons test (see Table 7). Scale bars=50 µm.  \n \n.
