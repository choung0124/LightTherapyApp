Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream.

Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA.

Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

            "originalText": "As cancer cells have an anabolic demand and are known to depend on glycolysis\nand autophagy to meet their energy requirement, circadian regulation of metabo-lism and autophagy underlies one connection. Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensingpathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitrycan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepaticgluconeogenesis [ 25,26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/BMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogene-sis. It is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,and insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thusderepression of the CLOCK complex [ 28]. This provides one pathway that com-\nmunicates metabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, whichactivates a downstream G protein Gsand increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [ 29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thustemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [ 30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn\n2+ﬁnger tran-\nscription factor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven byintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [ 31].\n21.3.2 NAD+Sensing Pathways\nNAD+levels ﬂuctuate with metabolic state.

PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent.

In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3).

Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72.

The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143).

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
