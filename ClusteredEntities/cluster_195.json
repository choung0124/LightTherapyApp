This is true only insomuch as taking a historyand performing a neurologic examination are consideredcomplex. PD is a clinical diagnosis for which no imaging orlaboratory testing is required. Brain imaging is frequentlyincorporated into research studies but is not required for aclinical diagnosis according to diagnostic criteria from theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSociety,\n2which have an accuracy of over 90%.3Magnetic\nresonance imaging and I-123 single-photon emission com-putedtomographyscansareoccasionallyusedtodistinguishPD from rarer causes of parkinsonism but are frequently notperformed\n4andthereisnoroleformagneticresonanceangi-\nography in diagnosing PD. The 2 measures of PD severityin this study are even simpler. Hoehn and Yahr stage is a5-point scale that grades functional disability based onwhether a person’s symptoms are unilateral or bilateral andwhether they can walk with or without assistance. It can begleaned from watching someone walk down a hallway for 10seconds. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale is astandardized neurologic examination that takes about 10minutes to perform. Training is available online through theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSocietywebsiteandnonphysicianresearchershaveadminis-tered it as part of population-based studies, such as theAging, Demographics, and Memory Study.\nFundusphotographyisrapidandefficient,butspeedalone\nshould not justify developing an imperfect (and potentiallycostly)surrogatewhenthegoldstandardisalreadyeasytomea-sure. That PD severity can be predicted from retinal photo-graphs at all is remarkable and the authors\n1should be con-\ngratulatedonthisachievement.Butasitstands,thisworkfeelslike a solution in search of a problem.
