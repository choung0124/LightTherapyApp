However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways.

            "originalText": " 2020). REM sleep has\nbeen postulated as an index of brain plasticity (Elia et al.\n2000). Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in ﬁrst\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3 ,\nBhlhe41 ,Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep –wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that ﬂuctu-\nating melatonin levels have a signi ﬁcant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampaldysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;4\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena.

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.  Keywords: Autism, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, clock genes, suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin. 1. INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

Their locomotor activity was recorded per 3 -\nmin interval  and monitored to ensure the entrainment to the housing LD cycles. The animals \nwere subjected to one hour of light ( enriched for long or short wavelengths) at ZT 14. The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.

On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena.

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

When purified from liver nuclear extracts, all \nof these proteins appear to be part of the same 1.9­MDa \ncomplex. However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65].

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

Therefore, besides the established diag-nostic method, many studies have been conducted to inves-tigate the potential metrics for PD, translating these intoclinically practical tools for the diagnosis and treatment ofpatients with PD.\nThe unique features of the retina make it a useful\nassessment tool for various systemic diseases. First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Second, due to a common embryonicorigin, the brain and retina share many biological featuresthatplayaprominentroleinthepathogenesisofmajorneu-rodegenerative diseases, including PD.\n8-18Recent studies\nhave reported that PD progression is associated with thestructural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and sug-gest the potential role of the retina as a modality for assess-ing PD progression.\n16-21Recently, deep learning algorithms\nhave been used in several medical fields. Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD. Moreover, heat maps were evaluated inthe macular area to confirm the anatomic association of ouralgorithm’s function. Furthermore, external validation forthe assessment function of this algorithm was conductedusing 2 independent hospital data sets to test the functionof our algorithm in different clinical settings.Methods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThisdecisionanalyticalmodel,conductedfromMay1toSep-tember 30, 2021, adheres to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki. The study protocol was reviewed and approved bytheinstitutionalreviewboardofKangbukSamsungHospital.Except for the fundus photographs used for external valida-tion,allparticipants’writteninformedconsentwasacquiredforthisstudy.ThisstudyfollowedtheConsolidatedHealthEco-nomic Evaluation Reporting Standards ( CHEERS ) reporting\nguidelines.\nFor external validation, we used the fundus photo-\ngraphs of patients with PD who visited the ophthalmologydepartment of Seoul National University Hospital andYeungnam University Hospital. Patients with PD wererecruitedfromtheMovementDisordersClinicoftheneurol-ogy department of Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from Octo-ber 7, 2020, to April 30, 2021.
