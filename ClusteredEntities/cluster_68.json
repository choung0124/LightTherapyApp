            "originalText": "Next, we examined negative masking  behavior  as described above.  A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

            "originalText": "Next, we examined negative masking  behavior  as described above.  A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) .

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the light itself. The rods or cones that likely underlie the phototransduction of the light \nflash to an electrochemical signal can resensitize during the darkness between flashes, increasing the photon \ncapture and extrinsic drive on the ipRGC  19,22. When administering flash therapy during sleep, the flashes must \npass through closed eyelids, which reduces the amount of light striking the cornea in a wavelength-dependent \nmanner, with 86% (at 700 nm) to 97% (below 580 nm)  attenuation23,24.\nAs the sensitivity of the SCN to light varies over the course of a typical sleep period, so too does the temporal \norganization of sleep stages, reflective of the intricate interplay between homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian OPEN\n1Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 2Palo Alto \nVeterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. 3Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center, \nVA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. *email: jzeitzer@stanford.edu",

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of elec -\ntronic and vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone \nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The \nshoulder (λ  ≈ 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corre -\nsponds to this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective \nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecu -\nlar plasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent \ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules \ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal \nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The \nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation) \nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of \nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading \nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary \nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting the vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1 \nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in \nSupplementary Videos 2–4, respectively, obtained from first-principles \nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm calculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density \nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT), \nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at \n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short lon -\ngitudinal charge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with \ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended \nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations \ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of \nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions \nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400–600 nm) are inac -\ncurately overestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm−1 \n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 × 1013 s−1) \nfor 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethyl-4,4′,5,5′-dibenzo-2,2′-indotricarbocyanine \nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy \nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the \nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18. \nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption \nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode, \nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm−1 corresponds to \nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 ",
