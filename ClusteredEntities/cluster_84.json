Interestingly, a recent study on MIA in\nmice demonstrated a link between circadian disruption\nand neurodevelopmental disorder (Delorme et al. 2021).These ﬁndings suggest a possible impact of prenatal\ncircadian disruption on ASD-risk in the offspring and also\nindicate the possibility of direct detrimental effects of a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm during prenatal development\non immunological sequelae and risk to ASD in offspring,\niii) Another possible mechanism through which circadian\nrhythm could alter immune functioning is through\nalteration of the gut microbiota. Dysregulated circa-\ndian rhythm has long-lasting effects on gut microbiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated withinsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gut microbiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninﬂuences the host ’s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional os-cillations and may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel in ﬂammation, including neuroin ﬂammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to dis-\neases, including neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiotaalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressfulconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay betweencircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O\n2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a signi ﬁcant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxida-tive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS medi-\nated oxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disul ﬁde\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012).

            "originalText": "Next, we examined negative masking  behavior  as described above.  A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].  Physiologically, two mechanisms are responsible for sleep-wake patterns: the sleep-wake-dependent homeostatic processes and the circadian rhythms. Homeostatic p r e s s u r e  t o  i n i t i a t e  a n d  maintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness [123, 124]. In addition to the homeostatic issue, determination of the sleep/wake cycle periodicity is characterized by the circadian timing system, e v e n  i n  t h e  absence o f  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  c u e s  [ 1 2 4 ] .  The harmony between homeostatic processes and circadian timing system form the typical pattern of sleep and wakefulness in adults under normal conditions, consisting of approximately 16 hours of constant wakefulness during the d a y  a n d  8  h o u r s  o f  c o n s o l i d a t e d  sleep at night, although sleep needs may change along with the course of life [123, 124]. In humans, multiple sleep/wake cycles are observed during the day and nighttime until the fourth month of age, then, daytime sleep progressively decreases, and by five years of age, the biphasic sleep/wake cycle is fully established [125, 126]. The normal sleep/wake rhythms seem to be crucial for appropriate cognitive development in children. Transient or permanent sleep ",

This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH.

In the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged car-\ndiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the ﬂow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Simi-\nlarmoleculessuchasCy7.5-amine,Cy7-amine,Cy5.5-amine,and\nCy5-amine should also dock into the lipid bilayers.

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].  Physiologically, two mechanisms are responsible for sleep-wake patterns: the sleep-wake-dependent homeostatic processes and the circadian rhythms. Homeostatic p r e s s u r e  t o  i n i t i a t e  a n d  maintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness [123, 124]. In addition to the homeostatic issue, determination of the sleep/wake cycle periodicity is characterized by the circadian timing system, e v e n  i n  t h e  absence o f  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  c u e s  [ 1 2 4 ] .  The harmony between homeostatic processes and circadian timing system form the typical pattern of sleep and wakefulness in adults under normal conditions, consisting of approximately 16 hours of constant wakefulness during the d a y  a n d  8  h o u r s  o f  c o n s o l i d a t e d  sleep at night, although sleep needs may change along with the course of life [123, 124]. In humans, multiple sleep/wake cycles are observed during the day and nighttime until the fourth month of age, then, daytime sleep progressively decreases, and by five years of age, the biphasic sleep/wake cycle is fully established [125, 126]. The normal sleep/wake rhythms seem to be crucial for appropriate cognitive development in children. Transient or permanent sleep ",

This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH.

In the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged car-\ndiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the ﬂow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Simi-\nlarmoleculessuchasCy7.5-amine,Cy7-amine,Cy5.5-amine,and\nCy5-amine should also dock into the lipid bilayers.

Therefore,\nidentifying potential tools for the assessment of cognitivefunction that are readily accessible and reliable for patientswith PD is of particular clinical importance. In this decisionanalytical model, our algorithm showed an AUROC of 0.77for both the H-Y scale and UPDRS-III score based on ourmultimodal approach (Figure 2). A diverse score distribu-tion for UPDRS-III in our data set may lead to a lower sensi-tivity and specificity for UPDRS-III, as compared with theH-Y scale in this study. Moreover, the lower AUROC of ouralgorithm for the data at different hospitals was anticipated\nbecause there were no additional clinical data available (ex-cept for age and sex) for the external validation data set.Further studies are needed to add information on clinicaldata assessment function from fundus photography imagesto our algorithm, which will ensure a better cognitiveimpairment assessment function, regardless of data source.\nThedeeplearningmethodenablesustoinvestigatepoten-\ntial tools that are usually difficult to study through conven-tional investigation methods.
