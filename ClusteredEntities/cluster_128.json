Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Total running distance and preference for\nrunning in the dark were measured after all mice had completely\nre-entrained after a phase shift and were averaged across 2 days.\nTo determine free running period, after all mice had completely re-\nentrained they were switched to DD and period was calculated from\nthe onset of activity across 7 days.\nIn masking trials, light intensity was decreased by wrapping\nﬂuorescent lights in neutral density ﬁlter ﬁlms and measured witha spectrometer (Sekonic Spectrometer C-800). Illuminance was\nmeasured in lux, and photon ﬂux, summed from 380 to 780 nm,\nwas calculated using formulas in the supplementary materials in\nLucas et al. (2014). A 1hr light pulse was delivered from ZT13-\n14. Percent running in light was calculated by comparing to the\nactivity measured during the same period of constant darkness on\nthe preceding day for each mouse. Individual trials were separated\nfrom each other by 3–4 days.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org",

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",
