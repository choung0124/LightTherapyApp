CLOCK hetero-\ndimerizes with BMAL1 and acts as positive regulator of theloop. The CLOCK-BMAL1 complex binds to enhancer box\n(E-box) and drives rhythmic expression of the negative\nregulators, the period (PER1, PER2, and PER3), and cryp-\ntochrome (CRY1 and CRY2) proteins. These negative regu-\nlators can dimerize themselves to form a homodimer\n(PER-PER) or heterodimer (PER-CRY). The PER-CRY heter-\nodimer translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and\ninhibits gene expression induced by CLOCK-BMAL1\n(Reppert and Weaver 2002). In addition to the primaryCLOCK-BMAL1 feedback loop, there is another regulatory\nfeedback loop which is driven by retinoic acid-related\norphan nuclear receptor alpha (ROR α) and REV-ERB α.\nStudies have shown that ROR αand REV-ERB αregulate the\ntranscription of BMAL1 through retinoic-acid-related\norphan receptor elements (ROREs) (Guillaumond et al.\n2005). ROREs activate the transcription of BMAL1, whereas\nREV-ERBs suppress the transcription of BMAL1 and also\nrepress transcription of CLOCK and CRY1 genes (Preitner\net al. 2002). The period, phase, and amplitude of circadian\nrhythm are in ﬂuenced by circadian gene variants and\nentrained by environmental factors such as exposure to\nlight, social cues, mealtimes, and work schedules.\nUnder normal circumstances, people exhibit various\ncircadian phenotypes or chronotypes.

            "originalText": "variants of the clock genes are signi ﬁcantly associated with\nthe chronotype, like morningness (Jones et al. 2016). There\nis an association of genetic or polymorphic variants of\ncircadian genes with a range of neuropsychiatric, meta-\nbolic, malignant, and cardiovascular disorders (Jagannath\net al. 2017). A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications inneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nu-\ncleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.Studies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCN also modi ﬁed\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This sug-\ngested that the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as thecircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCN were cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmarkstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmit-\nters profoundly in ﬂuence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for re ﬁning circadian output\nrhythm in mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as theperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behav-\nioral that entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astro-cytes can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to im-pairments in learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010). More importantly, a recent study on mice has\nestablished that BMAL1 deletion and its reduced expres-\nsion promoted neuronal cell death by regulating neuronal\nredox homeostasis; implying a critical role of impaired\nTable :Mammalian genes regulating circadian rhythm and the effect of their mutations.\nGenes Functions Effect of mutations\nCLOCK It is a transcription factor.

Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019).

Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathol-\nogies, including cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021). Melatonin supplementation\nhas shown promising results in treating sleep onset\ninsomnia in children with ASD (Malow et al. 2012, 2021).10\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

            "originalText": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00    5 disorders are among the most common medical complaints in soci-ety and have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behav-ior [20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, a n d  q u a l i t y  o f  l i f e  [ 1 1 3 ,  128].  The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56].

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence.

This data implicates rhythmic PPAR\nexpression is supported by both the circadian clock and the feeding-fasting cycle.\n21.4 Health Implications of Circadian Disruption\nIn the last century, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in modernsocieties have shifted from infectious diseases to noninfectious chronic diseasesincluding hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer,and diseases of chronic inﬂammation [ 49]. Chronic disruption of circadian rhythm\nin experimental animals or as commonly experienced among shift workers raisesthe risk for many of these diseases. These correlative observations have catalyzed arapidly expanding research into understanding the mechanism underlying theconnection between circadian disruption and chronic diseases. We will discuss a\nfew examples here and encourage the readers to explore these connections in\nseveral recently published excellent reviews [ 23,41,47,50,51].\n21.4.1 Genetic Perturbations\nGenetic perturbation of circadian oscillator in mice predisposes to metabolic\npathologies. Such genetic perturbation models have been invaluable in understand-ing the mechanistic link between the circadian clock proteins and metabolic\nhomeostasis. A comprehensive summary of metabolic diseases in circadian pertur-\nbation mouse models has been published recently [ 51]. Here we will cite a few\nexamples. The simultaneous inactivation of Cry1 and Cry2 results in hyperglyce-mia [ 52], while liver-speciﬁc BMAL1 knockout mice show hypoglycemia\n[25]. Altered glucose homeostasis is a hallmark of insulin resistance and type\n2 diabetes.

            "originalText": "As cancer cells have an anabolic demand and are known to depend on glycolysis\nand autophagy to meet their energy requirement, circadian regulation of metabo-lism and autophagy underlies one connection. Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensingpathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitrycan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepaticgluconeogenesis [ 25,26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/BMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogene-sis. It is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,and insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thusderepression of the CLOCK complex [ 28]. This provides one pathway that com-\nmunicates metabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, whichactivates a downstream G protein Gsand increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [ 29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thustemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [ 30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn\n2+ﬁnger tran-\nscription factor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven byintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [ 31].\n21.3.2 NAD+Sensing Pathways\nNAD+levels ﬂuctuate with metabolic state.

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA. Functionally active ROR-REVERB-response elements (RREs) are also448 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Chronic disruption of circadian rhythm\nin experimental animals or as commonly experienced among shift workers raisesthe risk for many of these diseases. These correlative observations have catalyzed arapidly expanding research into understanding the mechanism underlying theconnection between circadian disruption and chronic diseases. We will discuss a\nfew examples here and encourage the readers to explore these connections in\nseveral recently published excellent reviews [ 23,41,47,50,51].\n21.4.1 Genetic Perturbations\nGenetic perturbation of circadian oscillator in mice predisposes to metabolic\npathologies. Such genetic perturbation models have been invaluable in understand-ing the mechanistic link between the circadian clock proteins and metabolic\nhomeostasis. A comprehensive summary of metabolic diseases in circadian pertur-\nbation mouse models has been published recently [ 51]. Here we will cite a few\nexamples. The simultaneous inactivation of Cry1 and Cry2 results in hyperglyce-mia [ 52], while liver-speciﬁc BMAL1 knockout mice show hypoglycemia\n[25].

            "originalText": "As cancer cells have an anabolic demand and are known to depend on glycolysis\nand autophagy to meet their energy requirement, circadian regulation of metabo-lism and autophagy underlies one connection. Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3).

Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78.

The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143).

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

            "originalText": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00    5 disorders are among the most common medical complaints in soci-ety and have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behav-ior [20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, a n d  q u a l i t y  o f  l i f e  [ 1 1 3 ,  128].  The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].  Some circadian genes have been associated with ASD including PER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.
