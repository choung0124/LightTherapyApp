            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

            "originalText": "the period length is controlled. We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",
