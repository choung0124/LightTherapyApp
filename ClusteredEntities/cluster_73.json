            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

First, we ascertained in wild -type (WT) mice whether our two light \ntreatments differentially regulated negative masking behavior , light-induced phase shifts of \ncircadian behavior as well as the light-evoked c -Fos response in the suprachiasmatic nucleus \n(SCN) .

Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .
