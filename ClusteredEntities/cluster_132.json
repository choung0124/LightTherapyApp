            "originalText": "in the development and function of the nervous system\n(Nguyen et al. 2018; Olde Loohuis et al. 2012). miRNAs have\nemerged as key elements in circadian clock regulation in\nrecent times. Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well",

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",

Inspection of individual hypnograms indicated \nthat one individual had substantially more wake during exposure to the flash sequence (51 min) as compared \nto the control condition (1 min, Figure S1). This individual, however, was awake prior  to the onset of the flash \nsequence. Examination of the other six individual hypnograms did not indicate any substantive W during the \nflash sequence (Figure S1).\nA reverse power analysis, with alpha set to 0.05 and power to 0.80, indicates that given the observed 3.2-min \nstandard deviation in change in total wake duration during the 1-h stimulus (excluding the participant that was \nalready awake at the time of the flashes, Fig.  2), we could have detected a 4.8-min difference in the amount of \nwake.

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",

Inspection of individual hypnograms indicated \nthat one individual had substantially more wake during exposure to the flash sequence (51 min) as compared \nto the control condition (1 min, Figure S1). This individual, however, was awake prior  to the onset of the flash \nsequence. Examination of the other six individual hypnograms did not indicate any substantive W during the \nflash sequence (Figure S1).\nA reverse power analysis, with alpha set to 0.05 and power to 0.80, indicates that given the observed 3.2-min \nstandard deviation in change in total wake duration during the 1-h stimulus (excluding the participant that was \nalready awake at the time of the flashes, Fig.  2), we could have detected a 4.8-min difference in the amount of \nwake.

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",
