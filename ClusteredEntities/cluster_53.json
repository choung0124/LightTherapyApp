            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) .

            "originalText": "effect  of light on negative masking, light -induced phase shifts and light -induction of c -Fos in the \nSCN.  Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

This is true only insomuch as taking a historyand performing a neurologic examination are consideredcomplex. PD is a clinical diagnosis for which no imaging orlaboratory testing is required. Brain imaging is frequentlyincorporated into research studies but is not required for aclinical diagnosis according to diagnostic criteria from theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSociety,\n2which have an accuracy of over 90%.3Magnetic\nresonance imaging and I-123 single-photon emission com-putedtomographyscansareoccasionallyusedtodistinguishPD from rarer causes of parkinsonism but are frequently notperformed\n4andthereisnoroleformagneticresonanceangi-\nography in diagnosing PD. The 2 measures of PD severityin this study are even simpler. Hoehn and Yahr stage is a5-point scale that grades functional disability based onwhether a person’s symptoms are unilateral or bilateral andwhether they can walk with or without assistance. It can begleaned from watching someone walk down a hallway for 10seconds. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale is astandardized neurologic examination that takes about 10minutes to perform. Training is available online through theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSocietywebsiteandnonphysicianresearchershaveadminis-tered it as part of population-based studies, such as theAging, Demographics, and Memory Study.\nFundusphotographyisrapidandefficient,butspeedalone\nshould not justify developing an imperfect (and potentiallycostly)surrogatewhenthegoldstandardisalreadyeasytomea-sure. That PD severity can be predicted from retinal photo-graphs at all is remarkable and the authors\n1should be con-\ngratulatedonthisachievement.Butasitstands,thisworkfeelslike a solution in search of a problem.
