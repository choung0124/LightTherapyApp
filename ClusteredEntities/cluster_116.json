When it was not possible to measure the height, \nbecause the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm3), the tumour \nvolume was calculated as (1/2) × length × width2.\nPreparation of fresh solutions of Cy7.5-amine and DMSO for \nin vivo studies\nOn the day of treatment, a fresh solution of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine was \nprepared by diluting the 8 mM Cy7.5-amine stock in DMSO in PBS \nbuffer; the final dilution contained 2.5% DMSO. A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3. The volume of the tumours was calculated as (1/2) × len\ngth × width × height. When it was not possible to measure the height, because the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm\n3), the tumour \n",

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).

When it was not possible to measure the height, \nbecause the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm3), the tumour \nvolume was calculated as (1/2) × length × width2.\nPreparation of fresh solutions of Cy7.5-amine and DMSO for \nin vivo studies\nOn the day of treatment, a fresh solution of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine was \nprepared by diluting the 8 mM Cy7.5-amine stock in DMSO in PBS \nbuffer; the final dilution contained 2.5% DMSO. A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3. The volume of the tumours was calculated as (1/2) × len\ngth × width × height. When it was not possible to measure the height, because the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm\n3), the tumour \n",
