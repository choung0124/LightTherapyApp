However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA. Functionally active ROR-REVERB-response elements (RREs) are also448 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA. Functionally active ROR-REVERB-response elements (RREs) are also448 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

            "originalText": "the cell­ autonomous molecular circadian clock in mam­\nmals consists of interlocking TTFLs (Fig.  3). In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78. The biological \nfunction of another recently identified CLOCK–BMAL1 \nrepressor, PASD1, appears to be the damp",

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference.
