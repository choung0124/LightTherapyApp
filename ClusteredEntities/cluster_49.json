            "originalText": " they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021).

            "originalText": "Next, we examined negative masking  behavior  as described above.  A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",

Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep.

In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",
