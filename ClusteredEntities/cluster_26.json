            "originalText": "variants of the clock genes are signi ﬁcantly associated with\nthe chronotype, like morningness (Jones et al. 2016). There\nis an association of genetic or polymorphic variants of\ncircadian genes with a range of neuropsychiatric, meta-\nbolic, malignant, and cardiovascular disorders (Jagannath\net al. 2017). A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications inneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nu-\ncleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.Studies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCN also modi ﬁed\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This sug-\ngested that the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as thecircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCN were cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmarkstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmit-\nters profoundly in ﬂuence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for re ﬁning circadian output\nrhythm in mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as theperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behav-\nioral that entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astro-cytes can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to im-pairments in learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010). More importantly, a recent study on mice has\nestablished that BMAL1 deletion and its reduced expres-\nsion promoted neuronal cell death by regulating neuronal\nredox homeostasis; implying a critical role of impaired\nTable :Mammalian genes regulating circadian rhythm and the effect of their mutations.\nGenes Functions Effect of mutations\nCLOCK It is a transcription factor.

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.  Keywords: Autism, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, clock genes, suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin. 1. INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

(A) \nSpectral irradiance of the light emitted by the LED array using two lighting treatments: a short \nwavelength ( λ) enriched (10 lx, \npeak at 478 nm) and a long λ  \nenriched illumination (10 lx, \npeak at 608 nm). (B)  Light -\ninduced masking of activity in \nWT mice e xposed to either the \nshort λ  or long λ  enriched light \nfor one hour at ZT 14. The activity level during this light exposure was compared to that during the equivalent hour (ZT 14-15) on the day before the \ntreatment (baseline activity). (C)  \nExamples of light -induced \nphase shifts of wheel -running \nactivity onsets. After entrainment to the standard light:dark (LD) cycle, WT mice were placed into constant \ndarkness (DD) for 10 days and \nthen exposed to either short λ  \nor long λ  enriched illumination (10 lx, 15 min) at CT 16 (4 hours after the activity onset). Solid lines show \nlines running through activity onset before and after light treatment.  (D)  The short λ  enhanced \nillumination produced significant phase delays of the circadian system.  (E) Examples of light -evoked c -\nFos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Mice were exposed to either the short λ  or long λ  \nenriched illumination (10 lx) for 15 min at CT 16, perfused 45 min later and the brains collected. ( F) The \nshort λ  enhanced illumination produced a significant increase in the number of c -Fos positive cells in the \nSCN. Cells were counted in both the left and right SCN in two consecutive coronal sections per animal \nand the numbers averaged to obtain one value per animal. The histograms show the means  ± the \nstandard error of the mean (SEM).

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription.

These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential.

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.  Keywords: Autism, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, clock genes, suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin. 1. INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.
