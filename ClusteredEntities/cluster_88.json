These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

This eﬀect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the elec-\ntron density along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlengthofthepolymethinebridgeinﬂuencestheplasmonicityand\ntherebythevibroniceﬀecttopermeabilizecells(Figure S18,Sup-\nporting Information).

The weak TMP resonance is observed in the UV–vis spec-\ntrum of Cy7-amine at ≈380 nm in Figure S14(Supporting In-\nformation) and Cy5-amine at ≈320 nm in Figure S15(Support-\ning Information). 4) Substitution of the indole by other alterna-\ntive resonance structures, such as 1-methylquinoline, weakens\nthe plasmonicity and the VDA activity (Figure S20, Supporting\nInformation).

This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH.

            "originalText": "the period length is controlled. We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",

This eﬀect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the elec-\ntron density along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlengthofthepolymethinebridgeinﬂuencestheplasmonicityand\ntherebythevibroniceﬀecttopermeabilizecells(Figure S18,Sup-\nporting Information).

For the short contact times of 40 or\n50min,theMJHwasincubatedwithA375cells,thentheexcess\nwasremovedbycentrifugation,andthecellswereculturedfor2\nd.Thecellviabilitywasthenmeasuredbyacrystalviolettest.For\nthe long contact time, the MJH were incubated with A375 cells\nfor1or2daysandthentheviabilitywasimmediatelymeasured\nbyacrystalviolettest(Figures S40,S41,SupportingInformation).\nThemildeﬀectsatshortcontacttime( ≈40–50min)arethrough\na slow cell killing mechanism, likely apoptosis since the more\ncomplete killing is observed after culturing the cells for 2 days.\nThiscontrastswiththenecroticcelldeathinducedbyNIR-light-\nactivated VDA that takes 10 min to kill the cells. These are two\ndistinctive,andinsomeaspectsopposing,mechanismsofaction\nforcelldeath.[42,43]\nThequestionthatarisesregardingtheMJHcytotoxicitywith-\noutlightactivationis:DoestheMJHtoxicitydirectlycorrelateto\nthe VDA activity? To answer this question, we built 2D correla-\ntionplotscomparingtheVDAactivityunderlightactivationver-\nsusthetoxicityofthemoleculeswithoutlightactivation(Figure\nS42,SupportingInformation).Thereisnodirectcorrelationbe-\ntween the VDA activity and inherent toxicity. More importantly,\nBL-142, with relatively low inherent toxicity with respect to oth-\ners,retainshighVDAactivity.TheVDAactivitywasmeasuredby\nﬂowcytometryat10minimmediatelyafterlighttreatmentwhile\ntheinherenttoxicitywasmeasuredbycrystalviolettestaftercon-\ntinuousMJHexposuretothecellsfor2days.\n2.12.TheEﬀectofContactTimeintheCytotoxicityofMJHUsing\nClonogenicAssay\nFor additional assessment of the VDA activity versus the inher-\nent toxicity, both properties were measured using a clonogenic\nassay for cell viability. The exposure time in both experiments\nwas equal (Figure S43, Supporting Information), 7 h for both,\nfollowed by culture of the cells for 7 days to allow colony for-\nmation.Thecellsurvivalwascalculatedattheendofthecolony\nformation(Figures S44,S47,SupportingInformation).Lowerin-\nherenttoxicitymoleculesfromFigure S42(SupportingInforma-\ntion) were included in the analysis; additional molecules were\nsynthesized seeking to reduce their inherent toxicity.

The ratio of inherent\ntoxicity/VDA activity was deﬁned to identify the lead molecule\nwiththehighesttherapeuticindexofVDAactivityversusinher-\nenttoxicity(Figure S43C,SupportingInformation).Speciﬁcally,\nthe therapeutic index was deﬁned as the ratio of Tox LC50/VDA\nLC50.BL-141-2hasaconvenienthightherapeuticindexof22and\nav e r yl o wV D AL C50=18 nm to eradicate 50% of the cells and\nVDA LC100=40 nm to eradicate 100% of the cells. GL-261-2 is\nthe lead molecule with the highest therapeutic index of 62 and\naV D AL C50=80 nm (Figure S43D, Supporting Information).\nGL-261-2, with a therapeutic index of ≈60, is a plasmon-driven\nMJH candidate for translation to rodent studies, which is safer\nthan Cy7.5-amine (therapeutic index of ≈2–5 depending on the\nmethod used) that was successfully applied in vivo to eradicate\nmelanomatumorswithoutsignsoftoxicsideeﬀectsinmice.[23]\n3.Conclusion\nA library of 23 NIR 730 nm light-activated MJH displaying\nplasmon-driven vibrational action was designed and synthe-\nsized (Figures 1,2). This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH. The theoretical\nplasmonicityindex,basedoncomplexquantummechanicalcal-\nculations,hasbeendescribedelsewhere.[44,45]TheEPIcorrelates\nwiththeVDAactivitywhencomparingMJHwiththesameside\nchainsbutvariablecores(Figure 3C;F iguresS17–S20,Support-\ningInformation).\nMJH Cy5.5-amine binds to the cellular membrane, nuclear\nmembrane,andmitochondria(Figure S23,SupportingInforma-\ntion). In the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged car-\ndiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the ﬂow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Simi-\nlarmoleculessuchasCy7.5-amine,Cy7-amine,Cy5.5-amine,and\nCy5-amine should also dock into the lipid bilayers. It was con-\nﬁrmedthatCy7-aminetargetslocalizationincellularmembranes\nlike Cy5.5-amine (Figure S35, Supporting Information). This is\nsupporting evidence",

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",
