Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019).

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift.

            "originalText": "mice under standard conditions, but the shift of consumption to the light phase leads\nto weight gain and glucose intolerance [ 84]. In wild-type mice under nighttime-\nrestricted feeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50 % [ 85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accu-mulation of over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillator-deﬁcient Cry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [ 22]. These results indicate the power-\nful inﬂuence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [ 86,87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metaboliceffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later – even when both groups were con-\ntrolled for total caloric intake and physical activity [ 89]. In an evidence-based\neating time survey, majority of adult non-shift workers were found to spread theirdaily nutrient intake >14 h. A small subset of volunteers, after adopting a 10–11 h\neating schedule, reported sustained weight loss of ~4 % over a year with associatedimprovement in subjective measure of energy level during the day and sleep qualityat night [ 90]. The impact of daily eating-fasting rhythm on health may be pleiotro-\npic. In a retrospective analyses of self-reported 24 h food recall, a correlation\nbetween overnight fasting of /C2113 h and reduction in blood biomarkers of cancer\nrisk has been found [ 91]. This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feeding-\nfasting even under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provideprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolution-ary relevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. Whilethe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to meta-bolic syndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects. The timing of feeding and fasting, irrespective of total caloric intake, canreduce weight gain and improve metabolic parameters.

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensingpathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitrycan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepaticgluconeogenesis [ 25,26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/BMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogene-sis. It is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,and insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thusderepression of the CLOCK complex [ 28]. This provides one pathway that com-\nmunicates metabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, whichactivates a downstream G protein Gsand increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [ 29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thustemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [ 30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn\n2+ﬁnger tran-\nscription factor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven byintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [ 31].\n21.3.2 NAD+Sensing Pathways\nNAD+levels ﬂuctuate with metabolic state.

This data implicates rhythmic PPAR\nexpression is supported by both the circadian clock and the feeding-fasting cycle.\n21.4 Health Implications of Circadian Disruption\nIn the last century, the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in modernsocieties have shifted from infectious diseases to noninfectious chronic diseasesincluding hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer,and diseases of chronic inﬂammation [ 49]. Chronic disruption of circadian rhythm\nin experimental animals or as commonly experienced among shift workers raisesthe risk for many of these diseases. These correlative observations have catalyzed arapidly expanding research into understanding the mechanism underlying theconnection between circadian disruption and chronic diseases. We will discuss a\nfew examples here and encourage the readers to explore these connections in\nseveral recently published excellent reviews [ 23,41,47,50,51].\n21.4.1 Genetic Perturbations\nGenetic perturbation of circadian oscillator in mice predisposes to metabolic\npathologies. Such genetic perturbation models have been invaluable in understand-ing the mechanistic link between the circadian clock proteins and metabolic\nhomeostasis. A comprehensive summary of metabolic diseases in circadian pertur-\nbation mouse models has been published recently [ 51]. Here we will cite a few\nexamples. The simultaneous inactivation of Cry1 and Cry2 results in hyperglyce-mia [ 52], while liver-speciﬁc BMAL1 knockout mice show hypoglycemia\n[25]. Altered glucose homeostasis is a hallmark of insulin resistance and type\n2 diabetes.

In wild-type mice under nighttime-\nrestricted feeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50 % [ 85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accu-mulation of over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillator-deﬁcient Cry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [ 22]. These results indicate the power-\nful inﬂuence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [ 86,87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metaboliceffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake byimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [ 88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of directcell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolicdisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later – even when both groups were con-\ntrolled for total caloric intake and physical activity [ 89]. In an evidence-based\neating time survey, majority of adult non-shift workers were found to spread theirdaily nutrient intake >14 h. A small subset of volunteers, after adopting a 10–11 h\neating schedule, reported sustained weight loss of ~4 % over a year with associatedimprovement in subjective measure of energy level during the day and sleep qualityat night [ 90]. The impact of daily eating-fasting rhythm on health may be pleiotro-\npic. In a retrospective analyses of self-reported 24 h food recall, a correlation\nbetween overnight fasting of /C2113 h and reduction in blood biomarkers of cancer\nrisk has been found [ 91]. This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feeding-\nfasting even under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provideprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolution-ary relevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. Whilethe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to meta-bolic syndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects. The timing of feeding and fasting, irrespective of total caloric intake, canreduce weight gain and improve metabolic parameters.

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift.
