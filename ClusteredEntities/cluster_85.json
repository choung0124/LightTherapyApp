Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data. Conclusion: C u r r e n t  e v i d e n c e  s u p p o r t s  t h e  e x i s t e n c e  o f  a s s o c i a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  A S D  t o  c i r c a d i a n  d y s r e g u l a t i o n ,  behavior problems, increased inflammatory levels of cytokines, sleep disorders, as well as reduced circadian neuroendocrine responses. Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.  Keywords: Autism, neuroinflammation, circadian rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, clock genes, suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin. 1. INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",
