Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in ﬁrst\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3 ,\nBhlhe41 ,Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep –wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that ﬂuctu-\nating melatonin levels have a signi ﬁcant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampaldysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;4\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well as in humans have\nconvincingly demonstrated that the pharmacological\nmodulators of the circadian clock could emerge as potential\ntherapeutic drugs in diseases where circadian disruption\nplays a critical pathogenetic role (Antoch and Kondratov\n2013).

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .

Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].

ASD individuals present high levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, which is correlated with the reduced produc-tion of melatonin. On the other hand, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also described for the gene coding for ASMT in ASD subjects. B) individuals with normal-development present a high urinary excretion levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (a6MTs), suggesting a high fidedignity between the nocturnal pro-duction and excretion of melatonin metabolites (blue lines). Conversely, a6MTs levels in ASD is reduced (red lines) or even a phase-shifted excretion levels, suggesting that reduction of the nocturnal melatonin is impaired. Indeed, a6MTS rhythmic alterations were correlated with the activation of the immune-pineal axis.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

            "originalText": "the pineal gland to produce melatonin at night. A relationship has been reported\nbetween melatonin and light/dark variations in inﬂammatory systemic markers[70]. Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .

Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179].

Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].

In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.
