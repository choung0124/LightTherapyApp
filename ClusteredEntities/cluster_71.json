ROS \nscavengers do not retard the permeabilization of A375 cells to DAPI when treated with 2 μM Cy7.5-amine under illumination with 730 nm NIR light (80 mW cm\n−2 \nfor 10 min). (a ) Effect of 10 mM NAC (N -acetylcysteine). The exact p values \nobtained were 0.0004, 0.0005, 0.0969 and 0.6005 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (b ) Effect of 100 mM TU \n(thiourea). The exact p values obtained were 0.9071, 0.8021, 0.4631, and 0.5918 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (c) Effect of 2.5 mM SA (sodium azide). The exact p values obtained were 0.3712, \n0.2751, 0.4267, and 1.0 for the DMSO, DMSO + L, Cy7.5-amine, and Cy7.5-amine+L groups, respectively. (d ) Effect of ROS scavengers at variable irradiation time of \n730 nm NIR light at 80 mW cm\n−2. Five different scavengers were used: TU 100 mM, azide 2.5 mM, NAC 1 mM, Vit C (vitamin C) 5 mM and Met (methionine) 5 mM. DMSO control contains 0.1% DMSO in the media because DMSO is used to pre-solubilize the Cy7.5-amine stock solution at 2 mM and diluted to 1:1000 to obtain \n2 μM Cy7.5-amine in media containing 0.1% DMSO. Experimental groups are: \nDMSO = 0.1% DMSO, DMSO + L = 0.1 % DMSO + NIR light treatment, Cy7.5 = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine and Cy7.5 + L = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine + NIR light treatment. In all the plots 3 independent samples were processed and analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 3). In all plots data are presented as mean values ± SD, respectively. t -test, \ntwo-tail, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 Statistical significance p < 0.05, ns = not significant. Detailed flow cytometry data processing is described in Supplementary Information Fig. 5.",

(A) \nSpectral irradiance of the light emitted by the LED array using two lighting treatments: a short \nwavelength ( λ) enriched (10 lx, \npeak at 478 nm) and a long λ  \nenriched illumination (10 lx, \npeak at 608 nm). (B)  Light -\ninduced masking of activity in \nWT mice e xposed to either the \nshort λ  or long λ  enriched light \nfor one hour at ZT 14. The activity level during this light exposure was compared to that during the equivalent hour (ZT 14-15) on the day before the \ntreatment (baseline activity). (C)  \nExamples of light -induced \nphase shifts of wheel -running \nactivity onsets. After entrainment to the standard light:dark (LD) cycle, WT mice were placed into constant \ndarkness (DD) for 10 days and \nthen exposed to either short λ  \nor long λ  enriched illumination (10 lx, 15 min) at CT 16 (4 hours after the activity onset). Solid lines show \nlines running through activity onset before and after light treatment.  (D)  The short λ  enhanced \nillumination produced significant phase delays of the circadian system.  (E) Examples of light -evoked c -\nFos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Mice were exposed to either the short λ  or long λ  \nenriched illumination (10 lx) for 15 min at CT 16, perfused 45 min later and the brains collected. ( F) The \nshort λ  enhanced illumination produced a significant increase in the number of c -Fos positive cells in the \nSCN. Cells were counted in both the left and right SCN in two consecutive coronal sections per animal \nand the numbers averaged to obtain one value per animal. The histograms show the means  ± the \nstandard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed using one- way ANOVA ( Table 1) followed by the \nHolm -Sidak multiple comparisons test with the asterisks indicating significant difference between the \ngroups ( P < 0.05).    \n \n \n \n   \n \n.
