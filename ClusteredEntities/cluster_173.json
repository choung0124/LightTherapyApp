Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift.

            "originalText": "Next, we examined negative masking  behavior  as described above.  A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7).

            "originalText": "and sex -matched WT.  S ocial deficits were observed in mutants of  both sexes. Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

A gain, the WT mice \nexhibited a drastic  suppression of activity (42 ± 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any \nsignificant light -evoked change  on their  activity ( 9 ± 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously \nshown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect  of \nthe short λ illumination  was examined on this behavior  in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN \ngreatly reduced social interactions ( 57.4 ± 10%), while the mutant  mice were resistant to this \nnegative effect of night -time illumination ( 8.9 ± 8.2% , Fig. 2D, Table 2 ). Together these  data \nindicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.   \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in \nWT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long λ enriched  illumination would \nreduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms . Cohorts of Cntnap2  KO and WT mice \nwere first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12) , then randomly exposed to either long or \nshort λ enriched DLaN (10 lx ) for 2 weeks and  the waveforms examined ( Fig. 3A) . Under \nbaseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT con trols exhibited robust rhythms in \nactivity, although several  parameters  (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the \nCntnap2 KO mice  were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., \n2020) . When treated with the short λ enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both \ngenotypes was significantly altered ( Fig. 3A, B; Table 3 ) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice \nexhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long λ \nenriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3; Table \n3). These differences in the effects of the short and long λ illumination were strikingly evident \nwhen some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment ( Fig. 4 ). \nThese results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of \nthe light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of social behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls \n(Wang et al., 2020) , thus,  here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments \nusing a reciprocal social interaction test .  The short λ enriched DLaN treatment decreased social \nbehavior in both Cntnap2  KO and WT mice, while the long λ enriched light was without effect  \n(Fig. 5, Table  3). The short λ DLaN decreased social interactions (>10%) in 10 out of the 12 \nmutant mice evaluated, whereas the long λ  reduced social interactions in 5 out of 12 KO mice .

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

            "originalText": "and sex -matched WT.  S ocial deficits were observed in mutants of  both sexes. Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding siteand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1mRNA. Functionally active ROR-REVERB-response elements (RREs) are also448 B. Sarkisian et al.",

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic A band does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift. PS 50values were\ncalculated using Prism software (GraphPad) by ﬁtting a sigmoid\ndose-response curve to onset times in days 0–6 after light cycle shift\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org",
