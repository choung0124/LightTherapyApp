Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

Disturbed sleep-wake patterns, as well as abnormal melatonin and glucocorti-coid secretion, show the relevance of an underlying impairment of the circadian timing system to the behavioral phenotype of ASD. Thus, understanding the mechanisms involved in the circadian dysregulation in ASD could help to identify early biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and therapeutics as well as providing a significant impact on the lifelong prognosis. Objective: In this review, we discuss the organization of the circadian timing system and explore the connection between neuroanatomic, molecular, an d n euroe ndo crine res ponses  of ASD  and its clinical manifestations. Here  we propose interconnections between circadian dysregulation, inflammatory baseline and behavioral changes in ASD. Taking into account, the high relevancy of melatonin in orchestrating both circadian timing and the mainte-nance of physiological immune quiescence, we raise the hypothesis that melatonin or analogs should be consid-ered as a pharmacological approach to suppress inflammation and circadian misalignment in ASD patients. Strategy: T h i s  r e v i e w  p r o v i d e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  u p d a t e  o n  t h e  s t a t e-of-art of studies related t o  i n f l a m m a t o r y  states and ASD with a special focus on the relationship with melatonin and clock genes. The hypothesis raised above was analyzed according to the published data.

Indeed, major effects may be related to a low melatonin rhythm. We propose that maintaining the proper rhythm of the circadian timing system may be helpful to improve the health and to cope with several behavioral changes observed in ASD subjects.

INTRODUCTION  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental dis-order involving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal environment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis of ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and may be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the majority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical mani-festations as observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2",

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54].

MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65].

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
