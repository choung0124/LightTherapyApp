            "originalText": "and sex -matched WT.  S ocial deficits were observed in mutants of  both sexes. Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

            "originalText": "Fig. 7: The short, but not the \nlong, wavelength illumination \nelicits a selective increase in \nc-Fos immunopositive cells \nin the basolateral amygdala. \nBrains were collected at ZT 18 \nfrom WT (circles) and Cntnap2 \nKO (triangles) mice held in LD \nor exposed to the short λ  (teal) \nor the long λ (magenta) \nenriched DLaN (10 lx) for two \nweeks. ( A) The number of c -\nFos positive cells was \ndetermined bilaterally  in several \nbrain regions including the SCN, the peri -Habenula (pHb), \nthe paraventricular nucleus \n(PVN), the lateral hypothalamus \n(LH) and the basolateral \namygdala (BLA). The values from each region of interest (both left and right hemisphere, two consecutive slices/animal) \nwere averaged to obtain one \nvalue per animal (n=6), and are shown as the mean ± SEM (histograms with the values from the individual animals \noverlaid). Data were analyzed with a two- way ANOVA with \ngenotype and treatment as \nfactors (see Table 6) followed \nby Holm -Sidak multiple comparison test. Significant ( P < 0.05) effects of treatment or genotype are \nindicated with an asterisk or a crosshatch, respectively. ( B) Exposure to the short λ enriched DLaN  for \ntwo weeks activated more glutamatergic neurons in the mutants in comparison to the WT. Representative images of vGlut2- ZsGreen1 neurons immunopositive for c -Fos in the BLA of WT and Cntnap2 KO mice \nheterozygous for vGlut2- ZsGreen1. WT and Cntnap2 KO were perfused at ZT18 and the brains collected. \nThe total number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1 neurons and, among these, of those immunopositive for c -Fos was \ndetermined in 4 to 7 images acquired at random from 6 consecutive slices per animal (n=4). The values \nfrom each image per animal were averaged and analyzed with a two- way ANOVA followed by the Holm -\nSidak multiple comparisons test (see Table 7). Scale bars=50 µm.  \n \n.
