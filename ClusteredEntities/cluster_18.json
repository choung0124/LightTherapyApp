            "originalText": "variants of the clock genes are signi ﬁcantly associated with\nthe chronotype, like morningness (Jones et al. 2016). There\nis an association of genetic or polymorphic variants of\ncircadian genes with a range of neuropsychiatric, meta-\nbolic, malignant, and cardiovascular disorders (Jagannath\net al. 2017). A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications inneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nu-\ncleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.Studies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCN also modi ﬁed\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This sug-\ngested that the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as thecircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCN were cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmarkstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmit-\nters profoundly in ﬂuence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for re ﬁning circadian output\nrhythm in mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as theperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behav-\nioral that entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astro-cytes can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to im-pairments in learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010). More importantly, a recent study on mice has\nestablished that BMAL1 deletion and its reduced expres-\nsion promoted neuronal cell death by regulating neuronal\nredox homeostasis; implying a critical role of impaired\nTable :Mammalian genes regulating circadian rhythm and the effect of their mutations.\nGenes Functions Effect of mutations\nCLOCK It is a transcription factor.

            "originalText": " 2020). REM sleep has\nbeen postulated as an index of brain plasticity (Elia et al.\n2000). Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in ﬁrst\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3 ,\nBhlhe41 ,Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep –wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that ﬂuctu-\nating melatonin levels have a signi ﬁcant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampaldysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;4\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

Interestingly, a recent study on MIA in\nmice demonstrated a link between circadian disruption\nand neurodevelopmental disorder (Delorme et al. 2021).These ﬁndings suggest a possible impact of prenatal\ncircadian disruption on ASD-risk in the offspring and also\nindicate the possibility of direct detrimental effects of a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm during prenatal development\non immunological sequelae and risk to ASD in offspring,\niii) Another possible mechanism through which circadian\nrhythm could alter immune functioning is through\nalteration of the gut microbiota. Dysregulated circa-\ndian rhythm has long-lasting effects on gut microbiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated withinsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gut microbiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninﬂuences the host ’s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional os-cillations and may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel in ﬂammation, including neuroin ﬂammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to dis-\neases, including neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiotaalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressfulconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay betweencircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O\n2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a signi ﬁcant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxida-tive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS medi-\nated oxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disul ﬁde\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012).

It is\nbecoming increasingly apparent that the clock machin-\nery in the brain controls the genes of synaptic compo-\nnents like neuropeptides, neurotransmitter regulators,\nreceptors and transporters, ion channels, vesicle pro-\nteins, adhesion and scaffolding proteins, implying that\nthe clock machinery in ﬂuences synaptic plasticity\nthrough transcriptional control (Hannou et al. 2020).\nEpigenetic influence on circadian\nrhythmicity and ASD\nEpigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone\nmodification and noncoding RNA, like microRNA (miRNA)\nalterations respond promptly to environmental changes.\nInterestingly, rhythmicity in epigenetic events is evident in\ncells and tissues. The circadian system also has a signifi-\ncant influence on many epigenetic regulators. Epigenetic\nprocesses also have robust impacts on sleep patterns. Lack\nof sleep only for a single night alters both DNA methylation\nand the transcriptional profile of key circadian genes\n(Cedernaes et al. 2015). Altered DNA methylation seems toinﬂuence susceptibility to autism (Tremblay and Jiang\n2019).\nSleep loss has a profound impact on epigenetic mod-\nifications of circadian genes. This can confer risk to ASD\nand may influence the severity of ASD.

Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016).

Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response.

Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well",

            "originalText": "in the development and function of the nervous system\n(Nguyen et al. 2018; Olde Loohuis et al. 2012). miRNAs have\nemerged as key elements in circadian clock regulation in\nrecent times. Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019).

The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle.

The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020).

The circadian system also has a signifi-\ncant influence on many epigenetic regulators. Epigenetic\nprocesses also have robust impacts on sleep patterns. Lack\nof sleep only for a single night alters both DNA methylation\nand the transcriptional profile of key circadian genes\n(Cedernaes et al. 2015). Altered DNA methylation seems toinﬂuence susceptibility to autism (Tremblay and Jiang\n2019).\nSleep loss has a profound impact on epigenetic mod-\nifications of circadian genes. This can confer risk to ASD\nand may influence the severity of ASD.

Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016).

Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms.

            "originalText": ", which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well as in humans have\nconvincingly demonstrated that the pharmacological\nmodulators of the circadian clock could emerge as potential\ntherapeutic drugs in diseases where circadian disruption\nplays a critical pathogenetic role (Antoch and Kondratov\n2013). Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathol-\nogies, including cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021). Melatonin supplementation\nhas shown promising results in treating sleep onset\ninsomnia in children with ASD (Malow et al. 2012, 2021).10\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment.

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift.

It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005).

These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter.

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

            "originalText": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00    5 disorders are among the most common medical complaints in soci-ety and have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behav-ior [20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, a n d  q u a l i t y  o f  l i f e  [ 1 1 3 ,  128].  The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20].

[137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroven-tricular inflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and Per2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory condition leads to desynchronization of primary and s u b o r d i n a t e  brain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration be-tween the immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing body of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for maintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the c e l l s  t h a t  d r i v e s  biological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role of inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of social impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed as a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we observed worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordi-nation, and spatial memory when compared to the controls, which was associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia of hippocampal areas [141].

The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most prevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20].

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5. MELATONIN RHYTHM IN ASD  Among circadian disruptions in ASD, the diurnal rhythm of cortisol is altered in individuals with ASD, w h i c h  p r e s e n t  e le-vated cortisol in the evening [154].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005).

On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions[1], and 35 % suffer from metabolic syndrome [ 2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the ﬁve metabolic risk factors: largewaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, andhigh fasting glucose [ 3]. As of now, 60 % of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80 % of prema-ture stroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [ 4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependentrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increas-ingly apparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in bothprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm infeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly dur-\ning the daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovas-\ncular diseases and other metabolic complications [ 5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

            "originalText": "As cancer cells have an anabolic demand and are known to depend on glycolysis\nand autophagy to meet their energy requirement, circadian regulation of metabo-lism and autophagy underlies one connection. Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damageresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [ 78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadianclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathwayaffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link betweencancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter thecircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [ 79].21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 451",

            "originalText": "As cancer cells have an anabolic demand and are known to depend on glycolysis\nand autophagy to meet their energy requirement, circadian regulation of metabo-lism and autophagy underlies one connection. Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",

For example, liver ­ specific chromatin \nloops mediate the recruitment of clock­ bound distal \nenhancers to relevant promoters\n200. Although CLOCK–\nBMAL1 have been proposed to function as pioneer ­ like \ntranscription factors, which promote DNA accessibility through nucleosome removal, more recent data suggest that BMAL1 rather binds to already­ accessible DNA \nsites, thereby conceivably increasing their exposure \nto other transcription factors\n223– 225. Although exactly \nhow BMAL1 is recruited to genomic target regions remains to be clarified, the very limited overlap between \nthe BMAL1 cistromes in different tissues suggests a role for cell­ type ­specific transcription regulators in \nthis process.\nThe size of the tissue­ specific circadian transcriptome \ncan be greatly amplified through an intermediate layer of differentially expressed transcription regulators, which are directly controlled by the core molecular clock and in \nturn mediate the circadian expression of further down­\nstream targets. Examples of this include the PARbZip transcription factors DBP , TEF and HLF, which show different expression patterns in the SCN as well as many \nperipheral tissues\n70,226,227. The PARbZip proteins are \ndirect transcriptional targets of CLOCK–BMAL1 while controlling the rhythmic expression of genes containing \nD­ box elements in their regulatory regions. At least in \nthe liver, PARbZip targets include many major detoxi­fication enzymes, thereby illustrating the importance of \ncircadian considerations in drug metabolism\n228.\nLast, it should be noted that despite an overall shared \nmolecular clock identity throughout the body, some \ntissue­ specific adaptations to the canonical molecu­\nlar clock do exist. For example, alternative forms of CLOCK–BMAL1 inhibition — through hepatocyte \nnuclear factor 4A and PASD1 — have been described \nin liver and intestinal cells and in germline tissue, respectively\n79,229.\nEntrainment of circadian clocks\nCentral and peripheral clocks are aligned with the phase of external zeitgebers through entrainment. Zeitgebers \ninclude light, temperature, food, exercise and mechano­\nsensory stimulation, and entrain circadian rhythms by acting either on the central pacemaker or directly in peripheral tissues.\nClock entrainment in D. melanogaster\nOverall, entrainment of peripheral oscillators in insects is less dependent on a master pacemaker compared \nwith mammals, by virtue of their direct responsiveness \nto external zeitgebers such as light and temperature\n230. \nThe sensitivity of the circadian clock to a zeitgeber varies \nwith the phase during which it is applied, as described in \nso­ called phase­ response curves. When different groups \nof flies are exposed to 15­min light pulses at different zeitgeber times, a phase shift in the circadian locomotion \nwith respect to the original phase is observed at times of \nincreased sensitivity, such as after dusk and before dawn, but not during ‘dead zones’ , when light has no effect on the circadian phase\n231,232. In general, a light pulse at the \nbeginning of the night results in a phase delay due to \nthe transient degradation of cytoplasmic TIM, whereas a \nlight pulse in the early morning leads to phase advances owing to nuclear TIM degradation. A light pulse dur ­\ning the day has no impact on phase resetting, as during \nthis ‘dead zone’ TIM levels are too low to be affected by  \nlight­ induced degradation.\nThe D. melanogaster photoreceptor CRY , which is a \nflavoprotein similar to DNA photolyases\n233, is expressed \nin most clock­ containing tissues. Upon excitation with \nlight at a wavelength of 450 nm (the most potent zeit­\ngeber in D. melanogaster160, 234 and in mammals235),  \nCRY binds to TIM18, leading to recruitment of the \nE3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag19 and rapid degradation of \nboth CRY and TIM19,236 (Fig.  1), thereby resetting the \nclock231,237,",

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

The most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: in-creased latency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night waking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep depri-vation and interfere with productivity and quality of life [129]. Sleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in initiating and maintaining sleep. i.e s l e e p  latency and nocturnal awakenings) [20, 130-132].  ASD children had frequently delayed development of the cir-cadian sleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identifi-cation of sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of markers of vulnerability during infant’s development for early ASD screening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic traits in early childhood [133, 134].  The symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed that more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development of the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age. This problem is persistent since 4 0–93% of children with ASD show a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals aged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 ± 4.1 years old) showed that 59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type of sleep disorder.

Besides, disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disor-ders were  pre se nt  i n 13%,  a nd sleep hyperhidrosis was  pres e nt in 20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age 8.8 ± 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem al-most every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems found in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the gravity and frequency of these problems probably because of dif-ferences in methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also, sleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the increased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and de-creased quantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and decreased total sleep time [23, 138].  Clock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic disturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The ability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in the SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41, 49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al.

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .

Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179].

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

            "originalText": "8    Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2019, Vol. 25, No. 00 Pinato et al. parent education/interventions seems to be the most effective at ameliorating multiple domains of sleep problems [189].  It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference.

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running",

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic A band does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee. Animals were housed in a temperature and humidity\ncontrolled vivarium (22–24\u000eC,\u001840% humidity) and were provided\nwith food and water ad libitum . 3xTg experiments were conducted\nwith 8–13 mo female 3xTg mice on a B6129 background (Oddo\net al., 2003) (Jackson Laboratory #034830), with age-matched\nB6129SF2/J (Jackson Laboratory #101045) females as wild type\ncontrols. 5xFAD experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous 5xFAD mice on a C57BL/6J background (Oakley\net al., 2006) (Jackson Laboratory #034848), with littermates\ngenotyped as not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild\ntype controls. PS19 experiments were conducted with 7 mo female\nheterozygous PS19 mice on a B6C3 background (Yoshiyama et al.,\n2007) (Jackson Laboratory #008169), with littermates genotyped\nas not expressing the mutant transgene serving as wild type\ncontrols. For microglia depletion experiments, mice were given\nchow formulated with PLX3397 (660 mg/kg) or control chow for\n7 days before light cycle shift and were maintained on PLX or\ncontrol chow for the remainder of the experiment.\nBehavioral analysis\nBehavioral testing protocol was adapted from Grippo\net al. (2017). Mice were individually housed in cages\n(Nalgene) containing running wheels in light-tight boxes\nwhich were illuminated with timed ﬂuorescent lights\n(590\u00021012photons/cm2/s). Wheel running data were collected\nand analyzed with ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Activity\nonset was automatically detected by ClockLab software and when\nnecessary, corrected by eye by an experimenter blinded to genotype\nand treatment group. Mice were allowed to habituate to running\nwheel cages and entrained to a 12 h:12 h LD cycle for at least 7 days\nbefore experiments began.\nIn jet lag re-entrainment trials, the onset of the dark phase\nwas abruptly advanced by 6 h and running wheel activity was\nrecorded for at least 7 days after light cycle shift. PS 50values were\ncalculated using Prism software (GraphPad) by ﬁtting a sigmoid\ndose-response curve to onset times in days 0–6 after light cycle shift\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org",

In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference.
