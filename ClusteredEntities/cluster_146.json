Interestingly, a recent study on MIA in\nmice demonstrated a link between circadian disruption\nand neurodevelopmental disorder (Delorme et al. 2021).These ﬁndings suggest a possible impact of prenatal\ncircadian disruption on ASD-risk in the offspring and also\nindicate the possibility of direct detrimental effects of a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm during prenatal development\non immunological sequelae and risk to ASD in offspring,\niii) Another possible mechanism through which circadian\nrhythm could alter immune functioning is through\nalteration of the gut microbiota. Dysregulated circa-\ndian rhythm has long-lasting effects on gut microbiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated withinsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gut microbiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninﬂuences the host ’s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional os-cillations and may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel in ﬂammation, including neuroin ﬂammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to dis-\neases, including neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiotaalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressfulconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay betweencircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O\n2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a signi ﬁcant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxida-tive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS medi-\nated oxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disul ﬁde\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012).

Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) speci ﬁc\nto the brain in ﬂuence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are signi ﬁcantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019).

Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathol-\nogies, including cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021).

Besides this, recent studies also identi ﬁed mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). Theseﬁndings point towards important role of epigenetic pro-\ncesses of circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis ?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jinet al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well",

Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathol-\nogies, including cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has beengarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regu-\nlation in children with ASD. Given its roles in neuro-\ndevelopment, circadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021). Melatonin supplementation\nhas shown promising results in treating sleep onset\ninsomnia in children with ASD (Malow et al. 2012, 2021).10\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",
