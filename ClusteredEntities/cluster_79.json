As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min.

We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days.

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms.

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

(B)  Light -\ninduced masking of activity in \nWT mice e xposed to either the \nshort λ  or long λ  enriched light \nfor one hour at ZT 14. The activity level during this light exposure was compared to that during the equivalent hour (ZT 14-15) on the day before the \ntreatment (baseline activity). (C)  \nExamples of light -induced \nphase shifts of wheel -running \nactivity onsets. After entrainment to the standard light:dark (LD) cycle, WT mice were placed into constant \ndarkness (DD) for 10 days and \nthen exposed to either short λ  \nor long λ  enriched illumination (10 lx, 15 min) at CT 16 (4 hours after the activity onset). Solid lines show \nlines running through activity onset before and after light treatment.  (D)  The short λ  enhanced \nillumination produced significant phase delays of the circadian system.

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].

Homeostatic p r e s s u r e  t o  i n i t i a t e  a n d  maintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness [123, 124].

The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the light itself. The rods or cones that likely underlie the phototransduction of the light \nflash to an electrochemical signal can resensitize during the darkness between flashes, increasing the photon \ncapture and extrinsic drive on the ipRGC  19,22. When administering flash therapy during sleep, the flashes must \npass through closed eyelids, which reduces the amount of light striking the cornea in a wavelength-dependent \nmanner, with 86% (at 700 nm) to 97% (below 580 nm)  attenuation23,24.\nAs the sensitivity of the SCN to light varies over the course of a typical sleep period, so too does the temporal \norganization of sleep stages, reflective of the intricate interplay between homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian OPEN\n1Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 2Palo Alto \nVeterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. 3Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center, \nVA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. *email: jzeitzer@stanford.edu",

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running",

We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype.

            "originalText": " they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ). These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

            "originalText": " a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the light itself. The rods or cones that likely underlie the phototransduction of the light \nflash to an electrochemical signal can resensitize during the darkness between flashes, increasing the photon \ncapture and extrinsic drive on the ipRGC  19,22. When administering flash therapy during sleep, the flashes must \npass through closed eyelids, which reduces the amount of light striking the cornea in a wavelength-dependent \nmanner, with 86% (at 700 nm) to 97% (below 580 nm)  attenuation23,24.\nAs the sensitivity of the SCN to light varies over the course of a typical sleep period, so too does the temporal \norganization of sleep stages, reflective of the intricate interplay between homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian OPEN\n1Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 2Palo Alto \nVeterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. 3Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center, \nVA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. *email: jzeitzer@stanford.edu",

This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",
