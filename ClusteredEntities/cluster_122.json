The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the light itself. The rods or cones that likely underlie the phototransduction of the light \nflash to an electrochemical signal can resensitize during the darkness between flashes, increasing the photon \ncapture and extrinsic drive on the ipRGC  19,22. When administering flash therapy during sleep, the flashes must \npass through closed eyelids, which reduces the amount of light striking the cornea in a wavelength-dependent \nmanner, with 86% (at 700 nm) to 97% (below 580 nm)  attenuation23,24.\nAs the sensitivity of the SCN to light varies over the course of a typical sleep period, so too does the temporal \norganization of sleep stages, reflective of the intricate interplay between homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian OPEN\n1Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 2Palo Alto \nVeterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. 3Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center, \nVA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. *email: jzeitzer@stanford.edu",

Examination of the other six individual hypnograms did not indicate any substantive W during the \nflash sequence (Figure S1).\nA reverse power analysis, with alpha set to 0.05 and power to 0.80, indicates that given the observed 3.2-min \nstandard deviation in change in total wake duration during the 1-h stimulus (excluding the participant that was \nalready awake at the time of the flashes, Fig.  2), we could have detected a 4.8-min difference in the amount of \nwake.

This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28.

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations.

The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the light itself. The rods or cones that likely underlie the phototransduction of the light \nflash to an electrochemical signal can resensitize during the darkness between flashes, increasing the photon \ncapture and extrinsic drive on the ipRGC  19,22.

During the \n6.5 h after the intervention, anecdotal evidence indicated the absence of an effect on delta (B = 0.46), whereas \nthe levels of theta (B = 0.03), alpha (B = 0.02), sigma (B = 0.02), and beta (B = 0.02) power provided moderate \nevidence for H0.There was moderate evidence for more transitions between sleep and wake both during the flash \ntherapy (B = 9.02) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 4.11). Similarly, there was moderate evidence for more transi-\ntions between N2/N3 and N1 sleep both during the flash therapy (B = 4.06) and the 6.5 h following it (B = 8.30).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates that exposure to a sequence of light flashes for 1 h, timed at the beginning of sleep, can \nphase delay the circadian clock 1.13 ± 1.27 h on average, though ranging from 0 to 6.15 h. Polysomnography \nrecords suggested that no substantive differences occurred in sleep micro- or macro-architecture during or fol -\nlowing flash therapy. There was, however, evidence of an increase in delta power during the light flashes; this was \nlikely capturing an event-related potential. Bayesian assessment of sleep structure provided some evidence for \na difference in the number of shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep and from sleep to wake, both during \nand following flash therapy compared to the placebo. The largest phase shifts reported here are twice as large \ncompared to previously reported phase delays using 1 hour of flashed  light16 and three times as large as continu-\nous light of up to 10,000   lx9.\nThe potential efficacy of flash therapy in phase delaying the circadian clock has been explored  before16,17,20. \nWe used results from these previous studies to derive an optimal stimulus regarding timing, flash duration, \nfrequency, and light intensity. Despite the optimization, we still observe large variability in responses. This is \nunlikely due to the phase of light application as all participants were exposed to light flashes on average 2.86 h \nafter dim light melatonin onset which, according to the human phase response curve (PRC) to 1 h of continuous \n light9, should be the time at which maximal phase delays are observed. Statistically, the dispersion of the phase of \nlight application were similar and when we adjust the magnitude of the phase shift for the PRC, we still observe \nsignificant variability in responses. While it is possible that the PRC to flashed light is different from the PRC \nto continuous light, this is more likely to be in the magnitude rather than the shape of the curve. This type of \nhighly variable response to flashed light stimulus is consistent with that which has been reported in other species, \nincluding rodents and  Drosophila12–15. Given the divergence of the neural circuitry of circadian photoreception \nin these specifies, especially invertebrates compared to vertebrates, the variability therefore may be intrinsic to \nthe probabilistic nature of photoreception, converting an electromagnetic signal into an electrochemical signal. \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated",

From these data, the duration of each sleep state was calculated, as was the number of \ndeep (stage N3) to light (N2, N1) transitions and sleep (REM, N1, N2, or N3) to wake transitions. As the Stan-\nford-STAGES algorithm is a template matching-based system, the probability of each state was also calculated \nfor each 15-s epoch. For example, a given 15-s epoch could be scored as W , but have a probability distribution of \n0.89 W , 0.04 N1, 0.02 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.05 REM. Another 15-s epoch also scored as W could have a probability \ndistribution of 0.64 W , 0.19 N1, 0.03 N2, 0.00 N3, and 0.14 REM, indicating that the 15-s epoch has a greater \nmixture of states (i.e., W co-occurring with other states) than the first example. Calculations were performed \nseparately for polysomnography recorded during and after flash therapy. For three individuals, data on one of \ntheir visits showed too many artifacts to be analyzed (N = 7 for all polysomnography results).\nData analysis—sleep polysomnography: spectral power densities. Spectral analysis was per -\nformed by applying fast Welch’s Fourier transformation (FFT; hamming, 0% overlapped) on 3-s time  windows49 \n(package “rlseep” , version 1.0.650). Artifacts were removed based on sleep stage scoring. Power spectral densi-\nties were analyzed for delta (0.5–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz), sigma (12–14 Hz), and beta \n(15–30 Hz) power over the central derivations (C3, C4). Power spectral densities were calculated during flash or \nplacebo exposure (1-h interval), post-stimulus (6.5 h), per scored sleep stage (W , N1, N2, N3, or REM).\nStatistics. Linear model fitting was performed in R (R Core Team, version: 4.1.2), using the most recent shell \nof Rstudio (version: 2021.09) and the “lme4” R-package for mixed-effects modeling. Independent models were \nconstructed to calculate the effects of flash therapy on the circadian clock phase and sleep architecture. Phase \nchange, time spent in each sleep stage, the number of transitions from deep to light and sleep to wake, and the \nprobability scoring of W , N1, N2, N3, or REM were dependent variables. Intervention condition (placebo or \nflashes) was included as a fixed effect. Participant ID and visit number were included in all models as a random \neffect. To investigate if the magnitude of phase shift was influenced by sleep stage at the time of flash exposure, \na mixed model was created in which phase change was included as the dependent variable, and the interaction \nbetween sleep duration and sleep stage was included as a fixed effect. Separate models were created to investigate \nthe effects of flash exposure during sleep (stage N1, N2, N3, or REM) or wake. To investigate differences in power \nspectral densities, power in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands were added to linear mixed models as \ndependent variables, with intervention condition (placebo or flashes), and the interaction between intervention \ncondition and sleep stage (as factors) included as a fixed effect. A critical p-value of 0.05 was maintained for all \nstatistical circadian phase shift analyses. To correct for multiple testing, Bonferroni  correction51 was applied \nfor statistical evaluation of flash or placebo exposure on sleep staging (p = 0.007) and power spectral density \n(p = 0.01) calculations. Cohen’s d was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the flash and control \ntherapy by the standard deviation of that difference.
