            "originalText": "etric vibration rather than a collection of single \nvibrations9. This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of elec -\ntronic and vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone \nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The \nshoulder (λ  ≈ 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corre -\nsponds to this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective \nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecu -\nlar plasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent \ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules \ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal \nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The \nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation) \nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of \nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading \nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary \nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting the vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1 \nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in \nSupplementary Videos 2–4, respectively, obtained from first-principles \nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm calculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density \nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT), \nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at \n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short lon -\ngitudinal charge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with \ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended \nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations \ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of \nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions \nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400–600 nm) are inac -\ncurately overestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm−1 \n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 × 1013 s−1) \nfor 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethyl-4,4′,5,5′-dibenzo-2,2′-indotricarbocyanine \nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy \nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the \nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18. \nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption \nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode, \nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm−1 corresponds to \nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 ",

This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA.

These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6).
