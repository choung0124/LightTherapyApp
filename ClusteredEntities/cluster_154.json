Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).

Their locomotor activity was recorded per 3 -\nmin interval  and monitored to ensure the entrainment to the housing LD cycles. The animals \nwere subjected to one hour of light ( enriched for long or short wavelengths) at ZT 14. The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

The animals \nwere subjected to one hour of light ( enriched for long or short wavelengths) at ZT 14. The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.

The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAbplaques ( Figure 3A ), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C ). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice ( Figure 3B ). Behavior\nonset was signiﬁcantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2–4 after the shift ( Figure 3C ), and mean PS 50was\nreached 2.27 days earlier ( p<0.006) ( Figure 3D ). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot signiﬁcantly aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 3E, F ). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G ).
