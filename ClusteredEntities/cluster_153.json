On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min.

During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days.

A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3. The volume of the tumours was calculated as (1/2) × len\ngth × width × height. When it was not possible to measure the height, because the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm\n3), the tumour \n",

( a) Total and \npartial, by the orientation of the electric field component (Ei), absorption spectra \ncalculated by time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) using the Lanczos approach. The electric field is used to simulate the optical excitation of the Cy7.5-amine. The partial components of the spectrum are oriented along \nthe transversal molecular plasmon resonance (red), longitudinal (blue) and \nperpendicular (teal) axis of Cy7.5-amine. (b ) Absorption spectra comparison \nbetween the experimental (top) and the TD-DFT calculation (bottom). The dashed lines represent the position of the wavelengths at which the induced charge density maps were calculated for molecular plasmon resonances. The experimental shoulder at 730 nm for the vibronic mode in Cy7.5-amine is observed at 750 nm in the theoretical transversal component of the spectrum, \nbut it is less obvious in the total spectrum. (c ) Total induced charge densities \n[Δρ(r)] at 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths for molecular plasmon \nresonance. (d ) Induced charge densities [Δρ(r)] by electric field (E\ni) components \nat 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths oriented along the transversal, longitudinal and perpendicular axis of Cy7.5-amine. The vectors on the rightmost represent the orientation of the electric filed components. The long alkyl-amine \narm in Cy7.5-amine structure was not included in the electronic structure \ncalculation because it has negligible contributions to the conjugation of the core structure. Instead, a methyl group was substituted for the long alkyl-amine in Cy7.5-amine.",
