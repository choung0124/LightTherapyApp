Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment.

These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",

For example, liver ­ specific chromatin \nloops mediate the recruitment of clock­ bound distal \nenhancers to relevant promoters\n200. Although CLOCK–\nBMAL1 have been proposed to function as pioneer ­ like \ntranscription factors, which promote DNA accessibility through nucleosome removal, more recent data suggest that BMAL1 rather binds to already­ accessible DNA \nsites, thereby conceivably increasing their exposure \nto other transcription factors\n223– 225. Although exactly \nhow BMAL1 is recruited to genomic target regions remains to be clarified, the very limited overlap between \nthe BMAL1 cistromes in different tissues suggests a role for cell­ type ­specific transcription regulators in \nthis process.\nThe size of the tissue­ specific circadian transcriptome \ncan be greatly amplified through an intermediate layer of differentially expressed transcription regulators, which are directly controlled by the core molecular clock and in \nturn mediate the circadian expression of further down­\nstream targets. Examples of this include the PARbZip transcription factors DBP , TEF and HLF, which show different expression patterns in the SCN as well as many \nperipheral tissues\n70,226,227. The PARbZip proteins are \ndirect transcriptional targets of CLOCK–BMAL1 while controlling the rhythmic expression of genes containing \nD­ box elements in their regulatory regions. At least in \nthe liver, PARbZip targets include many major detoxi­fication enzymes, thereby illustrating the importance of \ncircadian considerations in drug metabolism\n228.\nLast, it should be noted that despite an overall shared \nmolecular clock identity throughout the body, some \ntissue­ specific adaptations to the canonical molecu­\nlar clock do exist. For example, alternative forms of CLOCK–BMAL1 inhibition — through hepatocyte \nnuclear factor 4A and PASD1 — have been described \nin liver and intestinal cells and in germline tissue, respectively\n79,229.\nEntrainment of circadian clocks\nCentral and peripheral clocks are aligned with the phase of external zeitgebers through entrainment. Zeitgebers \ninclude light, temperature, food, exercise and mechano­\nsensory stimulation, and entrain circadian rhythms by acting either on the central pacemaker or directly in peripheral tissues.\nClock entrainment in D. melanogaster\nOverall, entrainment of peripheral oscillators in insects is less dependent on a master pacemaker compared \nwith mammals, by virtue of their direct responsiveness \nto external zeitgebers such as light and temperature\n230. \nThe sensitivity of the circadian clock to a zeitgeber varies \nwith the phase during which it is applied, as described in \nso­ called phase­ response curves. When different groups \nof flies are exposed to 15­min light pulses at different zeitgeber times, a phase shift in the circadian locomotion \nwith respect to the original phase is observed at times of \nincreased sensitivity, such as after dusk and before dawn, but not during ‘dead zones’ , when light has no effect on the circadian phase\n231,232. In general, a light pulse at the \nbeginning of the night results in a phase delay due to \nthe transient degradation of cytoplasmic TIM, whereas a \nlight pulse in the early morning leads to phase advances owing to nuclear TIM degradation. A light pulse dur ­\ning the day has no impact on phase resetting, as during \nthis ‘dead zone’ TIM levels are too low to be affected by  \nlight­ induced degradation.\nThe D. melanogaster photoreceptor CRY , which is a \nflavoprotein similar to DNA photolyases\n233, is expressed \nin most clock­ containing tissues. Upon excitation with \nlight at a wavelength of 450 nm (the most potent zeit­\ngeber in D. melanogaster160, 234 and in mammals235),  \nCRY binds to TIM18, leading to recruitment of the \nE3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag19 and rapid degradation of \nboth CRY and TIM19,236 (Fig.  1), thereby resetting the \nclock231,237,",

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8.

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running",

In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype.

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAbis suﬃcient to alter re-entrainment.

These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modiﬁed and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have diﬀerent functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues.

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",
