As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

Their locomotor activity was recorded per 3 -\nmin interval  and monitored to ensure the entrainment to the housing LD cycles. The animals \nwere subjected to one hour of light ( enriched for long or short wavelengths) at ZT 14. The \nactivity level during this light exposure was compared to the activity level during the equivalent \nhour (ZT 14 to 15) on the day before the treatment. The fold change (%) was reported.  \nPhase shift of activity  rhythms    \nAfter the habituation to running wheel cages, a different cohort of WT mice (3 -4 mo) \nwere released into constant darkness (DD) for 10 days. The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Therefore, the clinical use of subjective meas-ures of sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, are validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].  Physiologically, two mechanisms are responsible for sleep-wake patterns: the sleep-wake-dependent homeostatic processes and the circadian rhythms. Homeostatic p r e s s u r e  t o  i n i t i a t e  a n d  maintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness [123, 124]. In addition to the homeostatic issue, determination of the sleep/wake cycle periodicity is characterized by the circadian timing system, e v e n  i n  t h e  absence o f  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  c u e s  [ 1 2 4 ] .  The harmony between homeostatic processes and circadian timing system form the typical pattern of sleep and wakefulness in adults under normal conditions, consisting of approximately 16 hours of constant wakefulness during the d a y  a n d  8  h o u r s  o f  c o n s o l i d a t e d  sleep at night, although sleep needs may change along with the course of life [123, 124]. In humans, multiple sleep/wake cycles are observed during the day and nighttime until the fourth month of age, then, daytime sleep progressively decreases, and by five years of age, the biphasic sleep/wake cycle is fully established [125, 126]. The normal sleep/wake rhythms seem to be crucial for appropriate cognitive development in children. Transient or permanent sleep ",

Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

(E)Free-running period (averaged over 7 days) in 8 mo mice maintained in constant darkness. (F)Percent of running\nperformed during the dark phase and (G)total distance run in 24 h (averaged over two 24 h periods) in 8 mo mice, n= 7–11. (H–N) Same as panels\n(B–G) but in 13 mo mice. n= 11–16 in panels (I–K) , 3–4 in panel (L), 8–13 in panels (M,N) . All analyses are two tailed Student’s t-tests unless\notherwise noted. All data plotted as mean \u0006SEM.\ncan contribute to disease progression. In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.
