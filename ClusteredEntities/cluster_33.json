            "originalText": "interactions and grooming, both sexes were compromised more in the mutant mice ( Table 5).  \nIn short, although we powered our sample size to detect possible sex differences, for the most \npart, both sexes were impacted by the Cntnap2  mutation. As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

            "originalText": "effect  of light on negative masking, light -induced phase shifts and light -induction of c -Fos in the \nSCN.  Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

            "originalText": "and sex -matched WT.  S ocial deficits were observed in mutants of  both sexes. Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53].

Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65].

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short λ enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long λ enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short λ enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short λ DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i",

The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47].

Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54].

The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65].

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

It is relevant to highlight that in addition to the infants, whose present reduced levels of melatonin, the mothers of ASD subjects also have decreased levels of melatonin at night [160]. One could argue a relationship between ma t e r na l  n u r s i n g  a n d  A S D  p a t i e n t s ;  however, no study has provided clear evidence for increased sus-ceptibility for having ASD offspring dependent on the reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. This can result in a circadian dysregula-tion of both mother and children since the daily variation of mela-tonin levels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour cycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several physiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit glucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to the SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174, 190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduc-tion of body temperature [192] at night should occur after the noc-turnal melatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the ad-justing of the temporal organization at several physiological proc-esses, such as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194] and proper neural function [100].  Indeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the daily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the de-creased melatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the local temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1 and MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock gene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore, pinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196]. Thus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in energy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions [96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock gene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabe-tes, and neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the fine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is important for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiol-ogy. Melatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary pars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals con-trolling the production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin secretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is also related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of peripheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose tissue [200].  Altogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the circadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD indi-viduals. We discussed that ASD individuals might have several points of impairment of brain development and maturation within the control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal areas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the brain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human rhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, in-cluding sleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence, and metabolic fitness.  Our current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagno-sis of simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be achieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the data for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on melatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neu-rological disturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep distur-bances, deficits in cognition and behavioral issues. CONCLUSION  Current evidence supports the existence of associations among ASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of mela-tonin and glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and increased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains elusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on l ac k of nocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves sleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and regulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for im-proving the diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of ASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection of behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear track about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD treatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which could complement the treatment of ASD.

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild A band tau pathology\n(Figure 1A ). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h ( Figure 1B ). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsigniﬁcantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift ( Figure 1C ), demonstrating more rapid re-\nentrainment. We calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS 50),\nand found that mean PS 50was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice ( p<0.006) ( Figure 1D ). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness ( Figure 1E ) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase ( Figure 1F ) and found no diﬀerence between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1G ), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not inﬂuenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I ), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was signiﬁcantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1–4 after the shift ( Figure 1J ). Mean PS 50at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster ( p<0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K ). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not aﬀected by genotype ( Figures 1L, M ). Total\nrunning was again not aﬀected by genotype ( Figure 1N ). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment ( Supplementary Figures 2A–F ).\nThese metabolic diﬀerences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype.

PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001).

PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ).

To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neuroﬁbrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020).

Following re-entrainment to the\nshifted light cycle in Figure 1 , 13-month 3xTg or WT mice were\nswitched to control or PLX chow (600 mg/kg) for 7 days to deplete\nmicroglia ( Figure 2B ). PLX treatment eﬀectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by >98% ( Figures 2C, D ). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored ( Figure 2E ). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on time of running onset ( Figure 2F ).\nAs in Figure 1 , behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p<0.001). PLX treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter PS 50in 3xTg\nmice ( Figure 2G ). There was a non-signiﬁcant trend toward higher\nPS50in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice ( p<0.415). There was\nno signiﬁcant eﬀect of treatment on PS 50(p<0.316), but the eﬀect\nof genotype on PS 50was again signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled ( Figures 2H, I ). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinﬂammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological A band\ntau expression in the brain.

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",
