            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design. Firstly, participants were \nsubjected to a 2-week circadian stabilization period with regular bed and wake times. The regular light exposure \nthat occurs with this type of sleep–wake schedule maximizes the circadian clock’s oscillation amplitude. This \ndeliberate setup effectively targeted the phase delay part of the phase response curve. However, without such \ncircadian phase stabilization, achieving precise targeting of the correct phase becomes challenging, potentially ",

            "originalText": "EM media was removed and the cells were washed twice with \nPBS buffer. Then, a mixture of fresh DMEM media without phenol red \nand with the MJH was added to the cells. The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were treated in four experimental ",
