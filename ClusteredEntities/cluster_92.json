            "originalText": " whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 s−1) using Raman spectros -\ncopy30. These subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations \nare terahertz-timescale (41 THz) oscillations, that is, they are seven \norders of magnitude faster than the megahertz (2–3 MHz) rotations \nelicited by Feringa-type motors1.\nMJH-mediated VDA on cells\nWe selectively excited the vibronic mode in a cell-membrane-bound \nCy7.5-amine using a NIR light-emitting diode (LED) at 730 nm  \n(Fig. 1e ), which resulted in the permeabilization of the cellular mem -\nbrane to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Fig. 1f ). DAPI is a \ncell-membrane-impermeable dye in viable cells that mainly stains cel -\nlular DNA in membrane-disrupted cells. While 730 nm light does not \nexcite the vibronic shoulder of Cy7-amine, it can activate Cy7.5-amine \n(Fig. 1e) and permeabilize A375 human melanoma cells immediately \nafter treatment (Fig. 2a–f ). It took ~30 s from the time the sample \nwas irradiated to start collecting the data in the flow cytometer. For \nthis experiment, 1 μM Cy7.5-amine and 730 nm LED irradiation at \n80 mW cm−2 for 10 min caused permeabilization to DAPI staining of \n99.6% of the A375 cells in a cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells. In \ncontrast, Cy7-amine was not able to permeabilize the cells under the \nsame conditions. This difference between the two aminocyanines supports the notion that the 730 nm light can excite the vibronic \nmode (shoulder) in Cy7.5-amine (Fig. 1e) causing cellular membrane \npermeabilization and ultimately cell death by necrosis, as seen by \nimmediate DAPI staining. The flow cytometry measurements showed \nthat both aminocyanines were attached efficiently to the cells in the \nabsence of irradiation (Fig. 2b,c ). It is interesting that Cy7-amine has a \nhigher extinction coefficient ( ε = 132,000 M−1 cm−1) at λ  = 730 nm than \nCy7.5-amine (ε  = 72,000 M−1 cm−1) in water, yet Cy7-amine does not per -\nmeabilize the cells at comparable concentrations, while Cy7.5-amine ",

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",

            "originalText": " whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 s−1) using Raman spectros -\ncopy30. These subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations \nare terahertz-timescale (41 THz) oscillations, that is, they are seven \norders of magnitude faster than the megahertz (2–3 MHz) rotations \nelicited by Feringa-type motors1.\nMJH-mediated VDA on cells\nWe selectively excited the vibronic mode in a cell-membrane-bound \nCy7.5-amine using a NIR light-emitting diode (LED) at 730 nm  \n(Fig. 1e ), which resulted in the permeabilization of the cellular mem -\nbrane to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Fig. 1f ). DAPI is a \ncell-membrane-impermeable dye in viable cells that mainly stains cel -\nlular DNA in membrane-disrupted cells. While 730 nm light does not \nexcite the vibronic shoulder of Cy7-amine, it can activate Cy7.5-amine \n(Fig. 1e) and permeabilize A375 human melanoma cells immediately \nafter treatment (Fig. 2a–f ). It took ~30 s from the time the sample \nwas irradiated to start collecting the data in the flow cytometer. For \nthis experiment, 1 μM Cy7.5-amine and 730 nm LED irradiation at \n80 mW cm−2 for 10 min caused permeabilization to DAPI staining of \n99.6% of the A375 cells in a cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells. In \ncontrast, Cy7-amine was not able to permeabilize the cells under the \nsame conditions. This difference between the two aminocyanines supports the notion that the 730 nm light can excite the vibronic \nmode (shoulder) in Cy7.5-amine (Fig. 1e) causing cellular membrane \npermeabilization and ultimately cell death by necrosis, as seen by \nimmediate DAPI staining. The flow cytometry measurements showed \nthat both aminocyanines were attached efficiently to the cells in the \nabsence of irradiation (Fig. 2b,c ). It is interesting that Cy7-amine has a \nhigher extinction coefficient ( ε = 132,000 M−1 cm−1) at λ  = 730 nm than \nCy7.5-amine (ε  = 72,000 M−1 cm−1) in water, yet Cy7-amine does not per -\nmeabilize the cells at comparable concentrations, while Cy7.5-amine ",

These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible \nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time \nof the perme",
