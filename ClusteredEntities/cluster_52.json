( a) Total and \npartial, by the orientation of the electric field component (Ei), absorption spectra \ncalculated by time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) using the Lanczos approach. The electric field is used to simulate the optical excitation of the Cy7.5-amine. The partial components of the spectrum are oriented along \nthe transversal molecular plasmon resonance (red), longitudinal (blue) and \nperpendicular (teal) axis of Cy7.5-amine. (b ) Absorption spectra comparison \nbetween the experimental (top) and the TD-DFT calculation (bottom). The dashed lines represent the position of the wavelengths at which the induced charge density maps were calculated for molecular plasmon resonances. The experimental shoulder at 730 nm for the vibronic mode in Cy7.5-amine is observed at 750 nm in the theoretical transversal component of the spectrum, \nbut it is less obvious in the total spectrum. (c ) Total induced charge densities \n[Δρ(r)] at 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths for molecular plasmon \nresonance. (d ) Induced charge densities [Δρ(r)] by electric field (E\ni) components \nat 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths oriented along the transversal, longitudinal and perpendicular axis of Cy7.5-amine. The vectors on the rightmost represent the orientation of the electric filed components. The long alkyl-amine \narm in Cy7.5-amine structure was not included in the electronic structure \ncalculation because it has negligible contributions to the conjugation of the core structure. Instead, a methyl group was substituted for the long alkyl-amine in Cy7.5-amine.",

Experimental groups are: \nDMSO = 0.1% DMSO, DMSO + L = 0.1 % DMSO + NIR light treatment, Cy7.5 = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine and Cy7.5 + L = 2 μM Cy7.5-amine + NIR light treatment.

            "originalText": "Nature Chemistry\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-023-01383-y\nExtended Data Fig. 1 | Calculated TD-DFT absorption spectrum and induced \ncharge density plots of the molecular plasmons in Cy7.5-amine. ( a) Total and \npartial, by the orientation of the electric field component (Ei), absorption spectra \ncalculated by time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) using the Lanczos approach. The electric field is used to simulate the optical excitation of the Cy7.5-amine. The partial components of the spectrum are oriented along \nthe transversal molecular plasmon resonance (red), longitudinal (blue) and \nperpendicular (teal) axis of Cy7.5-amine. (b ) Absorption spectra comparison \nbetween the experimental (top) and the TD-DFT calculation (bottom). The dashed lines represent the position of the wavelengths at which the induced charge density maps were calculated for molecular plasmon resonances. The experimental shoulder at 730 nm for the vibronic mode in Cy7.5-amine is observed at 750 nm in the theoretical transversal component of the spectrum, \nbut it is less obvious in the total spectrum. (c ) Total induced charge densities \n[Δρ(r)] at 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths for molecular plasmon \nresonance. (d ) Induced charge densities [Δρ(r)] by electric field (E\ni) components \nat 430, 530, 750 and 809 nm wavelengths oriented along the transversal, longitudinal and perpendicular axis of Cy7.5-amine. The vectors on the rightmost represent the orientation of the electric filed components. The long alkyl-amine \narm in Cy7.5-amine structure was not included in the electronic structure \ncalculation because it has negligible contributions to the conjugation of the core structure. Instead, a methyl group was substituted for the long alkyl-amine in Cy7.5-amine.",
