The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020).

Interestingly, a recent study on MIA in\nmice demonstrated a link between circadian disruption\nand neurodevelopmental disorder (Delorme et al. 2021).These ﬁndings suggest a possible impact of prenatal\ncircadian disruption on ASD-risk in the offspring and also\nindicate the possibility of direct detrimental effects of a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm during prenatal development\non immunological sequelae and risk to ASD in offspring,\niii) Another possible mechanism through which circadian\nrhythm could alter immune functioning is through\nalteration of the gut microbiota. Dysregulated circa-\ndian rhythm has long-lasting effects on gut microbiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated withinsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gut microbiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninﬂuences the host ’s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional os-cillations and may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel in ﬂammation, including neuroin ﬂammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to dis-\neases, including neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiotaalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressfulconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay betweencircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O\n2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a signi ﬁcant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxida-tive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS medi-\nated oxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disul ﬁde\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012).

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.

In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .

Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191. There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",

            "originalText": " however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).  Thus, SCN orchestrates many complex ‘ t i m e d ’  i n t e r n a l  s ys-tems, s u c h  a s  b o d y  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  e n d o c r i n e  f u n c t i o n s ,  a n d  b l o o d  pressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is translated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motiva-tional behaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by inter-acting with the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns [47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the peripheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist un-der a hierarchical control from t h e  S C N .  O t h e r w i s e ,  t h e  c o n f l i c t  between the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset several physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49]. Thus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system subject to different grades of misfits.  Abnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk for, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of hormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep was associated with early alterations in the development of autistic children´s brains [17, 26, 50-52].   The lack of control in the timing of brain development due to abnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behav-ioral changes [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD has been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymor-phisms in PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and ASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfam-ily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of transcription of Bmal1 g e n e  [ 5 5 ]  a s  w e l l  a s  m u t a t i o n s / S N P s  i n  CLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to sleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a mutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and sleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown to result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60]. 3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?  The ‘chemical signal of darkness’, melatonin, was first discov-ered and isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by Aaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melano-phores [62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin’s action in reproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several re-searchers confirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor secreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the syn-chrony of the environmental lighting and under the strict control of the SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that fine-tuning the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate ex-ternal lighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, includ-ing glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have consequences for health and disease [64].  The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis of melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase, activating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important relay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abol-ishes the nocturnal rise",

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5. MELATONIN RHYTHM IN ASD  Among circadian disruptions in ASD, the diurnal rhythm of cortisol is altered in individuals with ASD, w h i c h  p r e s e n t  e le-vated cortisol in the evening [154].

Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].

Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180].
