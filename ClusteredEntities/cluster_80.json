            "originalText": " whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 s−1) using Raman spectros -\ncopy30. These subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations \nare terahertz-timescale (41 THz) oscillations, that is, they are seven \norders of magnitude faster than the megahertz (2–3 MHz) rotations \nelicited by Feringa-type motors1.\nMJH-mediated VDA on cells\nWe selectively excited the vibronic mode in a cell-membrane-bound \nCy7.5-amine using a NIR light-emitting diode (LED) at 730 nm  \n(Fig. 1e ), which resulted in the permeabilization of the cellular mem -\nbrane to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Fig. 1f ). DAPI is a \ncell-membrane-impermeable dye in viable cells that mainly stains cel -\nlular DNA in membrane-disrupted cells. While 730 nm light does not \nexcite the vibronic shoulder of Cy7-amine, it can activate Cy7.5-amine \n(Fig. 1e) and permeabilize A375 human melanoma cells immediately \nafter treatment (Fig. 2a–f ). It took ~30 s from the time the sample \nwas irradiated to start collecting the data in the flow cytometer. For \nthis experiment, 1 μM Cy7.5-amine and 730 nm LED irradiation at \n80 mW cm−2 for 10 min caused permeabilization to DAPI staining of \n99.6% of the A375 cells in a cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells. In \ncontrast, Cy7-amine was not able to permeabilize the cells under the \nsame conditions. This difference between the two aminocyanines supports the notion that the 730 nm light can excite the vibronic \nmode (shoulder) in Cy7.5-amine (Fig. 1e) causing cellular membrane \npermeabilization and ultimately cell death by necrosis, as seen by \nimmediate DAPI staining. The flow cytometry measurements showed \nthat both aminocyanines were attached efficiently to the cells in the \nabsence of irradiation (Fig. 2b,c ). It is interesting that Cy7-amine has a \nhigher extinction coefficient ( ε = 132,000 M−1 cm−1) at λ  = 730 nm than \nCy7.5-amine (ε  = 72,000 M−1 cm−1) in water, yet Cy7-amine does not per -\nmeabilize the cells at comparable concentrations, while Cy7.5-amine ",

The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.

When it was not possible to measure the height, \nbecause the tumours were too small (usually <100 mm3), the tumour \nvolume was calculated as (1/2) × length × width2.\nPreparation of fresh solutions of Cy7.5-amine and DMSO for \nin vivo studies\nOn the day of treatment, a fresh solution of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine was \nprepared by diluting the 8 mM Cy7.5-amine stock in DMSO in PBS \nbuffer; the final dilution contained 2.5% DMSO. A 2.5% DMSO solution \nin PBS buffer was used as control.\nTreatment of B16-F10 tumours with Cy7.5-amine and NIR 730 nm light\nThe tumours were treated at day 13, counting from the day of cell \ninjection. The mice were divided into three groups: (1) Cy7.5-amine \nonly (n  = 4 mice per group), (2) 2.5% DMSO + light (n  = 5) and (3) \nCy7.5-amine + light (n  = 5). On the day of treatment, fresh solutions \n(200 μM Cy7.5-amine in PBS and control 2.5% DMSO in PBS) were pre-\npared as described above. The mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane \nusing a vaporizer. Then, each mouse was injected intratumourally with \n50 μl of 200 μM Cy7.5-amine solution in PBS or 2.5% DMSO in PBS. The \nmice were kept for 30 min in cages to allow the Cy7.5-amine or DMSO \nsolution to interact with the tumours. After the 30 min of incubation, \nthe mice were treated (under anaesthesia, using isoflurane) with a \n730 nm LED light source (Prizmatix), applying a power intensity of \n150 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The light intensity was measured using a Thor -\nlabs optical power meter (sensor model S302C and console model \nPM100D). During the light treatment, the temperature of the tumour \narea was measured using an IR thermal camera (Compact Seek Thermal \nfor Android, Seek Thermal). When the light treatment was finished, the \nmice were put back into the cages and housed in the animal facility. \nThis treatment was repeated once a day for 4 days. The tumour sizes were measured with a calliper every day starting from the day of hair removal using the depilatory cream. Then, after the four treatments, the tumours were measured every other day.\nGeneration of the human melanoma tumour model\nThe A375 cells were cultured as described above. The cells were col -\nlected from subconfluent plates (~90%), with fresh media added to the \ncells the day before collection. The cells were collected using 0.05% \ntrypsin–EDTA (Gibco, 25-300-054) and then redispersed in DMEM \nmedia without supplements at 50 × 106 cells ml−1. The cell suspension \nwas kept in ice. Then, 100 μl of cells was injected per mouse (5 million cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the right flank of 7–8-week-old female athymic nude mice. Starting at day 2, the tumours were meas-\nured using a calliper. Typically, the volume of the tumours at day 2 \nwas ~33 mm3.

            "originalText": " whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the \nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands, \nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28. \nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is \nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm−1 in the spectrum \nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this \nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm−1 (this is 24 fs \nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 × 1013 s−1) using Raman spectros -\ncopy30. These subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations \nare terahertz-timescale (41 THz) oscillations, that is, they are seven \norders of magnitude faster than the megahertz (2–3 MHz) rotations \nelicited by Feringa-type motors1.\nMJH-mediated VDA on cells\nWe selectively excited the vibronic mode in a cell-membrane-bound \nCy7.5-amine using a NIR light-emitting diode (LED) at 730 nm  \n(Fig. 1e ), which resulted in the permeabilization of the cellular mem -\nbrane to 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Fig. 1f ). DAPI is a \ncell-membrane-impermeable dye in viable cells that mainly stains cel -\nlular DNA in membrane-disrupted cells. While 730 nm light does not \nexcite the vibronic shoulder of Cy7-amine, it can activate Cy7.5-amine \n(Fig. 1e) and permeabilize A375 human melanoma cells immediately \nafter treatment (Fig. 2a–f ). It took ~30 s from the time the sample \nwas irradiated to start collecting the data in the flow cytometer. For \nthis experiment, 1 μM Cy7.5-amine and 730 nm LED irradiation at \n80 mW cm−2 for 10 min caused permeabilization to DAPI staining of \n99.6% of the A375 cells in a cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells. In \ncontrast, Cy7-amine was not able to permeabilize the cells under the \nsame conditions. This difference between the two aminocyanines supports the notion that the 730 nm light can excite the vibronic \nmode (shoulder) in Cy7.5-amine (Fig. 1e) causing cellular membrane \npermeabilization and ultimately cell death by necrosis, as seen by \nimmediate DAPI staining. The flow cytometry measurements showed \nthat both aminocyanines were attached efficiently to the cells in the \nabsence of irradiation (Fig. 2b,c ). It is interesting that Cy7-amine has a \nhigher extinction coefficient ( ε = 132,000 M−1 cm−1) at λ  = 730 nm than \nCy7.5-amine (ε  = 72,000 M−1 cm−1) in water, yet Cy7-amine does not per -\nmeabilize the cells at comparable concentrations, while Cy7.5-amine ",

The DMEM without phenol \nred was from Gen Clone (25–501C) and was supplemented with 10% \nFBS (Corning, 35010CV), 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution \n(Gibco, 11140050) and penicillin–streptomycin. The cells were incu -\nbated in the presence of the MJH at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then \nthe cells were imaged and photoactivated in the confocal microscope \n(Nikon A1-Rsi, Plan Apo IR ×60/1.27 water immersion objective and \nNIS-Elements AR5.21.03 software for imaging and data analysis, Rice University Shared Equipment Authority).\nTemperature measurements\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above. The temperature of the cell suspension was meas -\nured using a temperature probe (model SC-TT-K-30-36-PP, Omega \nEngineering) immersed in the media. The same process was repeated with the cell suspension on top of an ice bath. The temperature of the \ncell suspension was recorded in the same way during NIR light illu -\nmination. The temperature of the media remained constant at room \ntemperature (~20 °C) upon illumination of the media with 730 nm LED \nlight at 80 mW cm−2 for 10 min; a minor temperature increase of only \n0.4 °C was observed, which was attributed to the absorption of the \nillumination light by the media. Similarly, on ice, the temperature of \nthe media increased only 0.6 °C due to illumination by the 730 nm LED.\nROS scavenger experiments\nThe cell permeabilization and flow cytometry analysis were conducted \nas described above, but in this case, ROS scavengers (N -acetyl cysteine, \nthiourea, sodium azide, vitamin C or methionine) were added to the \ncell suspension and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before \nany treatment to allow the antioxidants to interact first and protect \nthe cells.\nCrystal violet cell viability assay\nThe crystal violet assay was used to measure cell viability. This assay \nis based on the principle that viable cells adhere to the surface of the \ncell culture dish, keep growing and remain attached during cell culture \nunder standard conditions for a period of 1–2 days as well as during \nstaining under the conditions of the assay. In contrast, dead cells do \nnot adhere to the surface of the cell culture dish, do not grow and \ndetach easily during the manipulation steps of the assay, which include \nremoval of media, exchange with fresh media and washing with PBS \nbuffer. In the cell viability assay, A375 cells were collected, counted, and \nthen 20,000 A375 cells were added to each well of a 24-well culture plate \n(Corning) and cultured for 1 day under the standard incubation condi -\ntions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.
