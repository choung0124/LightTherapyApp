Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased.

When purified from liver nuclear extracts, all \nof these proteins appear to be part of the same 1.9­MDa \ncomplex. However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145.
