Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .
