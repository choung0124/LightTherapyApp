The circadian time (CT) of their free -\nrunning sleep/wake cycles were monitored with the VitalView. The time of activity onset under DD was deﬁned as CT 12. On day 11, mice were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 \nlx, 60 min) at CT 16. After the treatment, the mice stayed in DD for following 10 days. And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .

And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

            "originalText": "Prior work has suggested that the microcircuit of the basolateral amygdala (BLA)  to  \nmPFC contributes to ASD -like behavior in mice. Felix -Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic \napproaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and \nshowed that the excited BLA /mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression \nfavoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic \nneurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from t he BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social \ninteraction was reduced while the self -grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA /vHp \npathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to \nthe vHPC attenuated optogenetic -evoked behavioral changes (Felix -Ortiz and Tye,  2014).   \nTherefore , we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in \nthe BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.   \nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms \nbut also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bu mgarner and Nelson , \n2021) , the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of \ndisease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered.  Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long -term care \ncenters, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz -Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; \nOsibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021).  Thus, n ightly light pollution is a very common \nenvironmental disruption to our circadian rhythms  all over the world, and this present study \nshows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.   \n \n  .
