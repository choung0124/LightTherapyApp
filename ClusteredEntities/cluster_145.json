            "originalText": "variants of the clock genes are signi ﬁcantly associated with\nthe chronotype, like morningness (Jones et al. 2016). There\nis an association of genetic or polymorphic variants of\ncircadian genes with a range of neuropsychiatric, meta-\nbolic, malignant, and cardiovascular disorders (Jagannath\net al. 2017). A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications inneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nu-\ncleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.Studies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCN also modi ﬁed\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This sug-\ngested that the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as thecircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCN were cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmarkstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmit-\nters profoundly in ﬂuence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for re ﬁning circadian output\nrhythm in mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as theperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behav-\nioral that entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astro-cytes can drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to im-pairments in learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010). More importantly, a recent study on mice has\nestablished that BMAL1 deletion and its reduced expres-\nsion promoted neuronal cell death by regulating neuronal\nredox homeostasis; implying a critical role of impaired\nTable :Mammalian genes regulating circadian rhythm and the effect of their mutations.\nGenes Functions Effect of mutations\nCLOCK It is a transcription factor.

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensingpathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitrycan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepaticgluconeogenesis [ 25,26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/BMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogene-sis. It is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,and insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thusderepression of the CLOCK complex [ 28]. This provides one pathway that com-\nmunicates metabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, whichactivates a downstream G protein Gsand increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [ 29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thustemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [ 30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn\n2+ﬁnger tran-\nscription factor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven byintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [ 31].\n21.3.2 NAD+Sensing Pathways\nNAD+levels ﬂuctuate with metabolic state.

However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

            "originalText": "expression of the bHLH transcription factor and onco­\nprotein MYC attenuates circadian cycling through down ­\nregulation of BMAL1, although the exact mechanism  \nremains to be clarified221,222.\nThird, cell­ type­specific variations in genome topol­\nogy and chromatin accessibility can contribute to the expression of unique sets of clock output genes in dif­ferent organs. For example, liver ­ specific chromatin \nloops mediate the recruitment of clock­ bound distal \nenhancers to relevant promoters\n200. Although CLOCK–\nBMAL1 have been proposed to function as pioneer ­ like \ntranscription factors, which promote DNA accessibility through nucleosome removal, more recent data suggest that BMAL1 rather binds to already­ accessible DNA \nsites, thereby conceivably increasing their exposure \nto other transcription factors\n223– 225. Although exactly \nhow BMAL1 is recruited to genomic target regions remains to be clarified, the very limited overlap between \nthe BMAL1 cistromes in different tissues suggests a role for cell­ type ­specific transcription regulators in \nthis process.\nThe size of the tissue­ specific circadian transcriptome \ncan be greatly amplified through an intermediate layer of differentially expressed transcription regulators, which are directly controlled by the core molecular clock and in \nturn mediate the circadian expression of further down­\nstream targets. Examples of this include the PARbZip transcription factors DBP , TEF and HLF, which show different expression patterns in the SCN as well as many \nperipheral tissues\n70,226,227. The PARbZip proteins are \ndirect transcriptional targets of CLOCK–BMAL1 while controlling the rhythmic expression of genes containing \nD­ box elements in their regulatory regions. At least in \nthe liver, PARbZip targets include many major detoxi­fication enzymes, thereby illustrating the importance of \ncircadian considerations in drug metabolism\n228.\nLast, it should be noted that despite an overall shared \nmolecular clock identity throughout the body, some \ntissue­ specific adaptations to the canonical molecu­\nlar clock do exist. For example, alternative forms of CLOCK–BMAL1 inhibition — through hepatocyte \nnuclear factor 4A and PASD1 — have been described \nin liver and intestinal cells and in germline tissue, respectively\n79,229.\nEntrainment of circadian clocks\nCentral and peripheral clocks are aligned with the phase of external zeitgebers through entrainment. Zeitgebers \ninclude light, temperature, food, exercise and mechano­\nsensory stimulation, and entrain circadian rhythms by acting either on the central pacemaker or directly in peripheral tissues.\nClock entrainment in D. melanogaster\nOverall, entrainment of peripheral oscillators in insects is less dependent on a master pacemaker compared \nwith mammals, by virtue of their direct responsiveness \nto external zeitgebers such as light and temperature\n230. \nThe sensitivity of the circadian clock to a zeitgeber varies \nwith the phase during which it is applied, as described in \nso­ called phase­ response curves. When different groups \nof flies are exposed to 15­min light pulses at different zeitgeber times, a phase shift in the circadian locomotion \nwith respect to the original phase is observed at times of \nincreased sensitivity, such as after dusk and before dawn, but not during ‘dead zones’ , when light has no effect on the circadian phase\n231,232. In general, a light pulse at the \nbeginning of the night results in a phase delay due to \nthe transient degradation of cytoplasmic TIM, whereas a \nlight pulse in the early morning leads to phase advances owing to nuclear TIM degradation. A light pulse dur ­\ning the day has no impact on phase resetting, as during \nthis ‘dead zone’ TIM levels are too low to be affected by  \nlight­ induced degradation.\nThe D. melanogaster photoreceptor CRY , which is a \nflavoprotein similar to DNA photolyases\n233, is expressed \nin most clock­ containing tissues. Upon excitation with \nlight at a wavelength of 450 nm (the most potent zeit­\ngeber in D. melanogaster160, 234 and in mammals235),  \nCRY binds to TIM18, leading to recruitment of the \nE3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag19 and rapid degradation of \nboth CRY and TIM19,236 (Fig.  1), thereby resetting the \nclock231,237,",
