            "originalText": " 2020). REM sleep has\nbeen postulated as an index of brain plasticity (Elia et al.\n2000). Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in ﬁrst\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3 ,\nBhlhe41 ,Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep –wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that ﬂuctu-\nating melatonin levels have a signi ﬁcant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampaldysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;4\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [ 34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,suggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence ofPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feedingwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liveroscillators [ 35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subse-\nquently affect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact amultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levelsincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activa-tion of FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [ 36–38].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regu-\nlatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulatessynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causesSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [ 39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act onthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,modulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can inﬂuence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretionand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1ain gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [ 40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to inﬂuence pathwaysthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the crosstalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [ 41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated inmetabolic processes [ 42].

A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle.

            "originalText": "the cell­ autonomous molecular circadian clock in mam­\nmals consists of interlocking TTFLs (Fig.  3). In the main \nloop, the positive elements that drive the circadian \ncycle are heterodimers of the basic helix–loop–helix \n(bHLH)–Per ­ Arnt­Sim (PAS) transcription factors \nBMAL1 (also known as ARNTL; orthologue of fly CYC) and CLOCK (orthologue of fly CLK). CLOCK–BMAL1 \nactivate the transcription of target genes that contain \ne/e′- box elements in their promoter and/or enhancer \nregions. These genes include the negative elements that attenuate the main loop — members of the mammalian \nPER and CRY protein families. PER1, PER2 and PER3 are orthologues of the D. melanogaster single PER pro­tein, and CRY1 and CRY2 are structurally related to the \nfly CRY . Although different PER and CRY paralogues \ncan to some extent compensate for loss of another para­logue, their roles in the mammalian clock are not com­pletely redundant. For example, circadian rhythmicity \nis only abolished upon inactivation of both CRY1 and \nCRY2, whereas their individual loss shortens or length­ens the circadian period, respectively\n66. At a later stage of \nthe cycle, complexes containing PER and CRY proteins \ninhibit the activity of CLOCK–BMAL1, effectively pre­\nventing their own continued production. Once PER and CRY levels sufficiently drop, CLOCK–BMAL1 ­mediated \ntranscription can resume, thus completing the cycle.\nIn addition to the PER  and CRY  genes, CLOCK–\nBMAL1 target genes include the nuclear receptors REV ­ \nERBα and REV ­ ERBβ (REV ­ ERBα/β), which together with retinoid­ related orphan receptor α (RORα), \nRORβ and RORγ (RORα/β/γ) form a second loop that ensures the rhythmic expression of BMAL1, analo­gous to the regulation of fly CLK by VRI and PDP1ε \n(reF s67,68). REV ­ ERBα/β and RORα/β/γ compete for \nbinding of REV ­ ERB–ROR response elements in the \npromoter and enhancer regions of target genes, includ­ing ARNTL, and inhibit or activate their transcription, \nrespectively\n69 (Fig.  3). Another CLOCK–BMAL1 target \ngene, D- box  binding protein (DBP), and its related proline \nand acidic amino acid­ rich– basic leucine zipper  (PARbZip) \ntranscription factors TEF and HLF, compete with NFIL3 \nto activate or inhibit, respectively, the expression of clock \ngenes from D­ box­containing promoters70,71.\nA notable difference between the D. melanogaster  \nand mammalian clocks is the role of the CRY proteins. Whereas the fly CRY (dCRY) is not a component of the core TTFL but feeds into it through its light­ dependent \ncontrol of TIM stability \n(Fig.  1), the mammalian CRY \nproteins have assumed the role of TIM and act as the \nmain transcriptional repressor of CLOCK–BMAL1 \n(Fig.  3). The primary function of the closest mammalian \nTIM homologue appears to be the protection of stalled replication forks\n72. However, as mammalian TIM can \ninteract with mammalian CRY proteins and its absence alters the circadian period, TIM has a sustained, if not \nentirely conserved, role in regulating the mammalian circadian clock\n73,74.\nA recent addition to our understanding of CLOCK–\nBMAL1 regulation has been the identification of CHRONO (also known as circadian­ associated repressor \nof transcription), which, like the CRY proteins, inhibits CLOCK–BMAL1 on E­ boxes, but does so through a dif­\nferent epigenetic mechanism\n75–77. Remarkably, CHRONO \nis the gene rhythmically expressed in the greatest num­\nber of tissues in a diurnal primate, surpassing even the \nbetter ­ known core clock components78. The biological \nfunction of another recently identified CLOCK–BMAL1 \nrepressor, PASD1, appears to be the damp",

REV ­ ERBα degradation medi­\nated by another E3 ligase, SIAH2, affects the circadian \nperiod length, whereas its degradation by the E3 ubiquitin \nligase FBXW7 following CDK1 ­mediated phosphoryla ­\ntion controls circadian amplitude, meaning the difference between the peak and trough values of the oscillation\n129,130.\nThe negative elements of the core molecular clock \nassemble into large multi­ protein complexes that contain \nall three PER proteins, both CRY proteins and CK1δ, into which CLOCK and BMAL1 are incorporated in the nucleus\n131. When purified from liver nuclear extracts, all \nof these proteins appear to be part of the same 1.9­MDa \ncomplex. However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.
