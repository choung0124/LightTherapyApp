Effect sizes were interpreted as small (d = 0.2), medium \n(d = 0.5), or large (d = 0.8). To measure the relative evidence for the H1 compared to H0 hypothesis, the Bayes \nFactor (B) was computed (package “BayesFactor”). We employed linear models (“lmBF”), wherein the varia-\ntion in the dependent factor was assessed under two scenarios: one involving the explanation based on the light \ncondition (full model), and the other involving explanation by random factors (null model). A B of 1 indicates \nFigure 7.  Example of circadian phase delay. Salivary melatonin during baseline (black) and the next day \nfollowing the stimulus during sleep (red) are indicated.",
