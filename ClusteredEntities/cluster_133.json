This is true only insomuch as taking a historyand performing a neurologic examination are consideredcomplex. PD is a clinical diagnosis for which no imaging orlaboratory testing is required. Brain imaging is frequentlyincorporated into research studies but is not required for aclinical diagnosis according to diagnostic criteria from theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSociety,\n2which have an accuracy of over 90%.3Magnetic\nresonance imaging and I-123 single-photon emission com-putedtomographyscansareoccasionallyusedtodistinguishPD from rarer causes of parkinsonism but are frequently notperformed\n4andthereisnoroleformagneticresonanceangi-\nography in diagnosing PD. The 2 measures of PD severityin this study are even simpler. Hoehn and Yahr stage is a5-point scale that grades functional disability based onwhether a person’s symptoms are unilateral or bilateral andwhether they can walk with or without assistance. It can begleaned from watching someone walk down a hallway for 10seconds. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale is astandardized neurologic examination that takes about 10minutes to perform. Training is available online through theInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement DisorderSocietywebsiteandnonphysicianresearchershaveadminis-tered it as part of population-based studies, such as theAging, Demographics, and Memory Study.\nFundusphotographyisrapidandefficient,butspeedalone\nshould not justify developing an imperfect (and potentiallycostly)surrogatewhenthegoldstandardisalreadyeasytomea-sure. That PD severity can be predicted from retinal photo-graphs at all is remarkable and the authors\n1should be con-\ngratulatedonthisachievement.Butasitstands,thisworkfeelslike a solution in search of a problem.

            "originalText": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common\nneurodegenerative disorder, and, owing to the agingpopulation, the number of patients with PD is\nexpected to double by 2030.\n1Projected PD prevalence will\nbe more than 1.6 million in the US with projected total eco-nomic burden surpassing $79 billion by 2037.\n2The diagno-\nsisofPDisbasedontheclinicalmanifestationsandfindingsfrom complex neuroimaging examinations, such as mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angi-ography (MRA), which contribute to medical burden amongpatients with PD. Therefore, besides the established diag-nostic method, many studies have been conducted to inves-tigate the potential metrics for PD, translating these intoclinically practical tools for the diagnosis and treatment ofpatients with PD.\nThe unique features of the retina make it a useful\nassessment tool for various systemic diseases. First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Second, due to a common embryonicorigin, the brain and retina share many biological featuresthatplayaprominentroleinthepathogenesisofmajorneu-rodegenerative diseases, including PD.\n8-18Recent studies\nhave reported that PD progression is associated with thestructural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and sug-gest the potential role of the retina as a modality for assess-ing PD progression.\n16-21Recently, deep learning algorithms\nhave been used in several medical fields. Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD. Moreover, heat maps were evaluated inthe macular area to confirm the anatomic association of ouralgorithm’s function. Furthermore, external validation forthe assessment function of this algorithm was conductedusing 2 independent hospital data sets to test the functionof our algorithm in different clinical settings.Methods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThisdecisionanalyticalmodel,conductedfromMay1toSep-tember 30, 2021, adheres to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki.
