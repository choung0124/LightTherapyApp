            "originalText": " \nIntroduction  \nDim light at night ( DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing \nsystem and has been linked to a range of negative consequences  (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn \net al., 2017 ). Prior work in pre -clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively \nimpacts the metabolism  (Fonken  et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017) , immune function ( Bedrosian \net al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016 ), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri \net al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) . Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum \ndisorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly \nfind difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; \nDevnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton  and \nMalow , 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more \ntime exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age -matched controls \n(Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021) . It has been \nspeculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be \ndetrimental to ASD populations . In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an  \nanimal model  with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein- like 2, \nCntnap2) show s reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a \n2-week exposure to DLaN ( Wang et al., 2020 ).  \nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by  the intrinsically \nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive  to shorter wavelengths (λ) of light with a peak response to 480nm light \n(Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive input s from rod and cone \nphotoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002 ; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods \ndriving the circadian response to sensitivity to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al \n2010).  These findings indicate  that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light \n(Foster et al., 2020) , and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of \nDLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night -time illumination is the only parameter that is \nbiological ly important?  In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether \nadjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic  stimulation  can be used as a \nstrategy to mi nimiz e disruption of circadian rhythms  (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; \nFigueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021) .   .

Indeed, 40–93% of ASD subjects may present alterations of sleep [18-23] and represents a circadian disturbance that can promote additional neurobehavioral dysfunc-tions as negatively influences cognition and behavior [20, 24-26], as well as changing endocrine responses, as melatonin and cortisol secretion [20, 27-29]. Although circadian rhythm dysregulation during brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD [18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present sleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34]. Besides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several aspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding of the multifactorial association between several aspects of cir-cadian misalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here we present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian rhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization of the circadian timing system and its close association between neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we in-cluded our current working hypothesis which suggests that at least part of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflamma-tory state linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreo-ver, these mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders typical of ASD. 2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYS-TEM   The circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several aspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by perceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information to the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection between SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak of cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance of this system for human settings relies on the premise that the cir-cadian timing system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for changes that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its physiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological functions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].   The oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcrip-tional feedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38]. Transcriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38]. Briefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by the circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to the transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2. The proteins translated from these genes form homo- or  he te r odi-mers that suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcrip-tion/translation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period (circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust circadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the whole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing cells, tissues, and functions.   Light input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypo-thalamic tract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular changes typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and consequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the syn-chrony of the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina that project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environ-mental light is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity, temperature, a n d  s o c i a l  interaction are relevant secondary time givers [39, 43, 45].  For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

For the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors, the connections from the SCN to other areas are established primar-ily through a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendo-crine responses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabo-lism, immune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional behavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

Zeitzer 1,3*\nIn humans, exposure to continuous light is typically used to change the timing of the circadian clock. \nThis study examines the efficiency of a sequence of light flashes (“flash therapy”) applied during \nsleep to shift the clock. Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18. The circadian system is sensitive to lower light intensities when receiving  flashes19, \nand preliminary evidence indicates it can be administered to individuals while sleeping without interfering with \n sleep18,20. While a single flash does not robustly influence the timing of the circadian  clock21, a sequence of flashes \nmay work by taking advantage of an unusual aspect of ipRGC physiology. ipRGC neurons continue to be depolar -\nized for several minutes following cessation of stimulation; thus, a flash of light can initiate a depolarization that \noutlasts the duration of the",

First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79).

Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD.
