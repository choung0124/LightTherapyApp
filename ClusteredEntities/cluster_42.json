The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neuro-developmental processes. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neu-\nrodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showingabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk andprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-\nrecognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotrans-\nmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-\ninflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiologicalsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neuro-\ndevelopmental; neuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxida-\ntive stress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biologicalrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioralvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physi-\nological and metabolic processes through the sleep –wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchro-\nnize with environmental cycles. Misaligned environ-\nmental cycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, pre-\ndominantly mood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matsonand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020).

Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior de ﬁcits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016).

As alter-\nations in immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle andoxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic mela-\ntonergic pathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm ‘resets ’immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm withmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal glandindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation withmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the im-\nmune response. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Ander-\nson and Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019).

As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions[1], and 35 % suffer from metabolic syndrome [ 2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the ﬁve metabolic risk factors: largewaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, andhigh fasting glucose [ 3]. As of now, 60 % of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80 % of prema-ture stroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [ 4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependentrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increas-ingly apparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in bothprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm infeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly dur-\ning the daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovas-\ncular diseases and other metabolic complications [ 5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [ 80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [ 22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must bedisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy torecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [ 81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in theliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [ 44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override thecircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolicsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [ 82]. Obe-\nsity, diabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.BMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activ-ity. When rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action andactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised – eithervia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light – are more obese-pronewhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [ 82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inﬂammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulinsecretion [ 83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and meta-\nbolic regulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composi-\ntion, weight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals andhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a majorportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle. However,mice housed in constant bright/dim light eat more than usual during the light phase[84]. Overall caloric intake and level of motor activity remain similar to that of452 B. Sarkisian et al.",

As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions[1], and 35 % suffer from metabolic syndrome [ 2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the ﬁve metabolic risk factors: largewaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, andhigh fasting glucose [ 3]. As of now, 60 % of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80 % of prema-ture stroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [ 4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependentrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increas-ingly apparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in bothprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm infeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly dur-\ning the daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovas-\ncular diseases and other metabolic complications [ 5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

The core components of the circadian clocknetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activatedthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night andform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [ 6]. These complexes associ-\nate with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activationpotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRYproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing anew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [ 6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-responseelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. Atnight, REV-ERB αprotein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoicacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1promoter to activate transcription [ 7,8]. These transcriptional-translational regula-\ntory loops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [ 9–11].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to ﬁne-tune its regulation based oninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumula-tion, the clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At thesame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several met-\nabolic organs and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism ’s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complexmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,with a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and periph-eral clocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to theambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [ 12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator andmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [ 13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.Rather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, inSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the21 Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases 445",

For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",
