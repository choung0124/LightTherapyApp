As with 3xTg mice, 7-month-\nold female 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer’s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org",

These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",

And best -\nfit lines of the activity onsets of sleep/wake cycles before and after the treatment were determined and compared.  \nPhotic induction of c- Fos in the SCN  and Immunofluorescence  \nA separate cohort of WT mice (n= 2 male and 2 female, 3-4 mo) was housed in DD \nconditions. The animals were exposed to long - or short -wavelength light (10 lx) for 15 mins at \nCT 16.  Forty -five mins later, the mice were euthanized with isoflurane (30% –32%) and  \ntranscardially perfused with phosphate- buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 4% (w/v) \nparaformaldehyde ( Sigma ). The brains were rapidly dissected out, post -fixed overnight in 4% \nPFA at 4 °C, and cryoprotected in 15% sucrose. Sequential coronal sections  (50 μm), \ncontaining the middle SCN , were collected using a cryostat (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL)  and then \nfurther processed for c -Fos immunofluorescence as reported below (Wang et al., 2017).  \nBehavioral tests  \nThe reciprocal social interaction test  was used to assess general sociability and interest \nin social novelty . On days of testing, the animals were taken out from the light -tight chambers, \nand habituated to the testing room for at least 30 mins. To avoid sleep disruptions, all behavioral \ntests were conducted in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 16- 18). The social behavior was \nevaluated by familiarizing the testing mouse with the testing arena first (habituation for 30 mins), \nand then introducing a never -met stranger mouse into the same arena. The stranger mouse had \nthe same age, sex, and genotype as the testing mouse. The two mice were allowed to interact for 10 mins, and the testing trials were recorded.

Healthy participants (n = 10) took part in two 36-h laboratory stays, receiving \na placebo (goggles, no light) during one visit and the intervention (goggles, 2-ms flashes broad-\nspectrum light for 60 min, delivered every 15 s, starting 30 min after habitual sleep onset) during the \nother. Circadian phase shift was assessed with changes in salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). \nSleep, measured with polysomnography, was analyzed to assess changes in sleep architecture and \nspectral power. After 1 h of flashes, DLMO showed a substantial delay (1.13 ± 1.27 h) compared to \nplacebo (12 ± 20 min). Two individuals exhibited very large shifts of 6.4 and 3.1 h. There were no \nsubstantive differences in sleep architecture, but some evidence for greater instability in sleep. 1 h of \nflash therapy during sleep evokes large changes in circadian timing, up to 6 h, and does so with only \nminimal, if any, impact on sleep. Flash therapy may offer a practical option to delay the circadian clock \nin shift workers and jet travelers.\nThe human circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, regulates \ndaily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological  variables1,2. The primary input of the SCN is \nlight, and light information, received by rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGC) cells in the retina, \nis sent to the SCN and other hypothalamic regions via the retinohypothalamic  tract3,4. Through this circuitry, \nthe circadian pacemaker synchronizes to the external natural or artificially imposed light–dark  cycle5. When \ntraveling across multiple time zones, that synchrony is temporarily lost. This process, called jet lag, can lead to \ndisrupted sleep and wake, increased daytime sleepiness, irritability, and  fatigue6.\nTo combat the negative consequences of jet lag, the human circadian system has to re-entrain endogenous \nphysiological and behavioral rhythms to the new light–dark  cycle7. This can be accomplished by repeated expo-\nsure to natural or artificial light at appropriate times of  day8. The greatest sensitivity of the SCN to light is during \nthe hours of habitual sleep, such that light early in the sleep period induces robust phase delays, and light late \nin the sleep period induces significant phase  advances9,10. As such, the optimal time of light exposure for rapid \nresynchronization to new time zones can require a decision to disrupt standard sleep patterns or to get light at a \nsuboptimal time. Furthermore, the process of re-entrainment using continuous light–dark exposure is relatively \nslow and can take up to several  days11.\nOne potential solution to this problem is the use of a potent light stimulus that can be administered during \nsleep—flash therapy. Flash therapy involves exposure to a sequence of light flashes rather than continuous light. \nIt has the potential to be at least twice as effective in phase-delaying the circadian system as compared to equi-\nluminant continuous light, a phenomenon observed in multiple animals, including  Drosophila12,  mice13,  rats14, \n hamsters15 and  humans16–18.

These results closely recapitulate the ﬁndings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tauis suﬃcient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment ( Supplementary\nFigures 2G–I ).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of A bpathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure ﬁne diﬀerences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be inﬂuenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without ﬁrst altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal’s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of diﬀerent intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg and WT mice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which diﬀerent intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice ( p<0.02), and 3xTg running was signiﬁcantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u00021012photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT",
