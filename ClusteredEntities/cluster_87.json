            "originalText": "(Fig. 5B, C). Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and phosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the penultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal and nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well as its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime levels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diur-nal activity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression but has increased nocturnal activity due to β1-adrenoceptor-induced PKA activation [84].  Melatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in G-coupled protein receptors and subcellular compartments and is re-leased at night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via t h e  p i neal recess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tis-sues ultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Be-sides, melatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including reduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation o f  C a 2 +-calmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) [91].   Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extra-pineal sites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94], skin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain [99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is positively mediated by NF-κB [64]. The dual effect of NF-κB in pinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is dependent on the NF-κB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus. Thus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a mediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect de-pends on the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis, which is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental lighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway [64].    The importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain function, i n c l u d i n g  A S D gai ns remarkabl e relevance, as chronic lower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological distur-bances, including ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induc-tion of the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are well-described in the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin anti-­‐inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxy-genase-­‐2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-­‐like receptor-­‐4 and NF-κB activation, upregulation of anti-­‐inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also impairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, re-straining the arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the stud-ies, anti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to pro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in the same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In cultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according to a previous activation of the NF-κB pathway. In the non-activated state, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin may determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunologi-cal responses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103, 107-109].  A question that is still open refers to the putative physiological role of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells. Overall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body rhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the physiological areas of the brain.

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5.

Our findings indicate that exposure to short λ enriched DLaN disrupted social \nbehavior in both genotypes, and the use of long er λ illumination could effectively reduce the \nimpact of DLaN on social behavior.  \n \nReduced melanopic  illumination  prevents DLaN -driven disruption of repetitive behavior in  \nCntnap2 KO mice.  \n  We have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO \nmutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, w e explored the effects of the two lighting \ntreatments on grooming behavior . As previously observed, the Cntnap2  KO exhibited higher \nlevels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions , and neither DLaN treatment altered \nthe levels of grooming in WT mice  (Fig. 6, Table 3) . The short λ enriched DLaN treatment \ntriggered a selective  increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Fig. 6, Table 3 ). \nIn particular, t he short λ  DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice \nevaluated while  the long λ DLaN  only affected  4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations \ndemonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent \nupon the λ used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on \nrepetitive behavior.   \nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN -driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.  \n Given the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to \ndetect possible sex difference in behavior.  First, we compared key measures of  activity \nrhythms, social interac tions and groom ing between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD \ncycle.  Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex ( Table 4 ) with the Cntnap2  KO \nshowing hypo- activity throughout the night.   As has been described previously, the activity \nwaveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels \nin the early night ( Supplemental Fig. 1).  We found a similar situation for social behavior where \nthere were significant effects of genotype but not sex ( Table 4).  By contrast, for grooming \nbehavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measure s of repetitive behavior ( Table 4).  Next, we compared \nthese same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short λ \nenriched DLaN conditions.  Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in \nany of the behaviors.  For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised ( Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2) .  For social .

            "originalText": "Nightly light exposure is a common environmental perturbation and has been shown to \ncause a number of ill effects (Lucassen et al., 2016; Bumgarner et al., 2021) . Some populations \nmay be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night.  For exam ple, in \nthe Cntnap2  KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive \nbehavior as measured by grooming  while  WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020).  On \nthe other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and \ndaily activity rhythms  in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice.  In the present study, we confirmed \nthese negative eff ects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive \nbehaviors ( Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would \nsolely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during \nthe day.  However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as \n90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets  (e.g. Klepeis et  al., 2001) . Therefore an \nappealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to \nminimize the negative effects.  As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to \ngenerate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly \nillumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.   \nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent \ncharacteristics (Lucas et al., 2014) . The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be \nmediated by ipRGCs  expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to \nlight with a peak response to ≈480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a \nnumber of studies have found evidence that short λ enriched lighting is more effective for \ncircadian responses ( for review see Brown, 2020).  However, recent work emphasizes that \nipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., \n2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian \nresponse to low -intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010)  like the 10 lx used in the \npresent study.  Here w e used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc. ) to tailor the spectral \nproperties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulat ing melanopic  stimulation.  The output of the \nLEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380 -780nm) using a \nspectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a C IE toolkit  which enabled us to estimate \nthat the s hort λ illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long λ illumination was 1 melanopic \nlx while maintaining illuminance at ≈ 10 lx .   \nUsing these two lighting treatments  with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, \nwe measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the \ncircadian system  (Fig. 1 ). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the .

Next, we examined the i nfluence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social \nbehavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin \nexpression.  We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to \ndisrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice ( Fig. 2). Together, this data indicates that ipRGCs are required for a majority of the \nnegative effects of DLaN and that controlling melanopic stimulation altered activation of the ipRGC/SCN pathway.      \nWith this validated lighting system in hand, we sought to use the LED array to determine \nwhether long λ enriched illumination would diminish  DLaN disruption of behavior in WT and \nCntnap2 KO mice.  Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity \nrhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic  \nillumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline ( Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, \nexposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions ( Fig. 5 ).  Finally, we found that \nexposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but \nnot the low melanopic DLaN ( Fig. 6 ).  Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic \nactivation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night -\ntime light exposure.   \nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of ∼4:1 \n(Fombonne, 2009) and there is  evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype \nin the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019).  Some of these sex \ndifferences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, \nincluding fewer repetitive behavior s in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013).  On the \nother hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt \net al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2  KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex \ndifference with home cage activity with robust hypo- activity in the males but no t in the female \nmutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in \nmale mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2  mutations than females (Townsend and \nSmith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex \ndifferences in activity rhythms. S ex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT \nmice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line ( Table 4;  S. Fig. 1 ). We did see evidence that the \nexcessive grooming , a measure of repetitive behavior , was more pronounced in the mutant \nmales than in the females , although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age .

As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions[1], and 35 % suffer from metabolic syndrome [ 2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the ﬁve metabolic risk factors: largewaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, andhigh fasting glucose [ 3]. As of now, 60 % of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80 % of prema-ture stroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [ 4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependentrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increas-ingly apparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in bothprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm infeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly dur-\ning the daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovas-\ncular diseases and other metabolic complications [ 5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptivemechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.Biochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:anabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.With the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.Hence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,use of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle witha bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-darkcycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of goingthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an importantdisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

We then discuss how \ncircadian activity contributes to the optimal function \nof tissues and organs, to organismal physiology and to \ndisease aetiology.\nThe molecular circadian clock\nAt the heart of the molecular circadian clock in animals is a transcription–translation feedback loop (TTFL), which \ntakes approximately 24 hours to complete. In this section, \nwe describe the chief components of the molecular oscil ­\nlators in D. melanogaster and in mammals, and discuss \nhow recent findings have improved our understanding of \nthese molecular clocks.\nThe molecular clock in D. melanogaster\nThe first mutants displaying altered circadian behaviour \nwere found in D. melanogaster11. A genetic screen for \nthe timing of eclosion , which occurs predominantly in \nthe morning in wild­ type flies, yielded an arrhythmic \nstrain named period0 (per0) and two additional mutants \nnamed period short  (perS) and period long  (perL), which \nshortened or lengthened the period to 19 h and 28 h, \nrespectively. Genetic tests suggested that all three muta­\ntions are alleles of the gene period , whose molecular \nidentity was subsequently determined12,13. In the follow­\ning years, screens for locomotor activity, which peaks at \ndusk and dawn, which were aided by the short generation \ntime and powerful genetics of D. melanogaster, uncov­\nered a network of circadian ‘clock genes’14. Biochemical \nand genetic studies ultimately revealed a TTFL in \nwhich two transcriptional inhibitors, Period (PER) and \nTimeless (TIM)15, physically associate and translocate \nto the nucleus, where they repress the transcription of \ntheir own genes by suppressing a pair of transcription \nactivators, Clock (CLK)16 and Cycle (CYC)17 (Fig.  1). CLK \nand CYC accumulate constitutively in the nucleus and \nform a heterodimer, which binds to E­ box­containing \nenhancers upstream of the promoters of per  and tim . The \nlevels of per  and tim  mRNAs peak at the end of the day, \nwhereas their protein levels are highest in the second half of the night \n(Fig.  2).\nAs PER and TIM accumulate in the nucleus, \nthey increasingly inhibit CLK–CYC function. Light ­ \ndependent TIM degradation occurs during the day \nthrough the activity of the photoreceptor protein Cryptochrome (CRY) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Jetlag \n(JET), which also degrades CRY\n18–20 (Fig.  1). In the \nabsence of TIM, PER is destabilized by Double ­ time \n(DBT)21,22, which is the fly orthologue of mammalian \ncasein kinases 1(CK1) δ and ε, and by the E3 ubiquitin ligase supernumerary limbs (SLIMB)\n23,24; the concomi­\ntant loss of PER and TIM restarts the circadian cycle. The transcriptional targets of CLK–CYC include down­\nstream clock output genes, whose cyclic expression con­fers circadian rhythmicity to cell and tissue function\n25–33. \nA second TTFL controls the expression of the clk  mRNA. \nCLK–CYC bind to E­ boxes in the enhancers of the genes \nencoding the transcription factors Vrille (VRI) and PAR domain protein 1ε (PDP1ε), which control clk  transcrip­\ntion\n34 (Fig.  1). VRI binds to VRI/PDP1ε ­ binding boxes in \nthe clk enhancer and represses clk transcription, whereas \nPDP1ε activates it later in the night, thus resulting in rhythmic clk mRNA expression. However, modulating \nthe phase in which the clk  mRNA is expressed does not \naffect behavioural rhythms35 and CLK protein does \nnot oscillate, so the role of rhythmic clk  mRNA expres­\nsion remains unclear. Nevertheless, PDP1ε is essential for rhythmicity\n36, possibly by controlling the expression \nof the neuropeptide pigment­ dispersing factor (PDF), \nwhich is required for behavioural rhythms37.\nRegulation of the molecular clock in D. melanogaster.  \nWhat regulates the precise timing for the TTFL",

The most commonly reported behav-iors across studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD subjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during the night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which likely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used bio-marker for the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin rhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By using these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able to detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, im-mune and circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of melatonin production and increased inflammation [153]. 5. MELATONIN RHYTHM IN ASD  Among circadian disruptions in ASD, the diurnal rhythm of cortisol is altered in individuals with ASD, w h i c h  p r e s e n t  e le-vated cortisol in the evening [154].

In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.
