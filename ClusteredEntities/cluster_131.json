            "originalText": " 2020). REM sleep has\nbeen postulated as an index of brain plasticity (Elia et al.\n2000). Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in ﬁrst\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuf ﬁe et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3 ,\nBhlhe41 ,Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep –wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that ﬂuctu-\nating melatonin levels have a signi ﬁcant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampaldysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;4\nF. Abdul et al.: Circadian abnormalities in ASD",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

            "originalText": " with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental conditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis, neurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the biological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased levels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well as deficits in the processing information and social interaction [168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes leads to translocation of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits Aanat c o d i n g  g e n e  e x p r e s s i o n  [ 1 6 9 ] .  O u r  r e c e n t  s t u d y  c o n f i r m e d  that in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and TNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD mediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown that the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may recognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine TNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that neurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine milieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or genes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation of the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and is a consequence of increased inflammation.  One of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis relies on its ability to induce the so-called, ‘extra-pineal’ synthesis of melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that this extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the cir-cadian orchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response derived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized rhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies as a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and prevent-ing light-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal, maybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.   Once synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately released into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central target tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a noctur-nal/circadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and physiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On the other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates non-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production, which may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival [64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most well-characterized pathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and activation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to pre-sent day/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and pri-mates, as well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regula-tion of biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in the genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated in ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior after the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon [176].  Considering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concen-tration i s  o f t e n  u s e d  a s  a  m a r k e r  o f  a  p a r t i c u l a r  p h a s e  o f  t he  c ir-cadian rhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erbα, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and",

In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

However, other studies have suggested the \nexistence of alternative clock­ repressive complexes in \nthe nucleus on the basis of the differential ability of PER and CRY proteins to repress CLOCK–BMAL1­mediated \ntranscription\n132– 136. We recently observed that an altered  \nform of CRY1 with an internal deletion of 24 residues owing to a splice site mutation, which predisposes  \nto \ndelayed sleep phase disorder , enhances CRY1 binding to  \nCLOCK–BMAL1 but not to PER2 and acts as a stronger transcriptional inhibitor than wild­ type CRY1 \n(reF.114).\nClock functions throughout the body\nThe master (central) pacemaker is comprised of a set of \nneurons and glia in the brain, which are necessary for \nentrainment to external zeitgebers and transmit temporal \ninformation to downstream peripheral clocks, which are located in other brain areas or throughout the body. The degree to which the central pacemaker is required for \ncircadian rhythmicity of different cells, tissues, physiolog­\nical functions and behaviours varies between species and tissues. To achieve synchrony between central pacemaker cells, they are coupled to each other through neuro­\ntransmitters and neuromodulators. Synchronization \nof central and peripheral clocks is coordinated by the nervous system, hormones and body temperature.\nThe central pacemaker in D. melanogaster\nThe expression of clock genes in a small number of neu­rons is necessary and sufficient to maintain functional \nbehavioural rhythms in constant darkness devoid of \nexternal zeitgebers\n137. In D. melanogaster, this neuronal \npacemaker network consists of ~150 neurons subdivided \ninto five bilateral clusters, which according to their loca­\ntion in the fly brain have been named large ventral lat ­\neral neurons, small ventral lateral neurons, dorsal lateral neurons, lateral posterior neurons and dorsal neurons. \nNot all clock neurons have the same function, and in fact \nthere is a subdivision into neurons responsible for dif­ferent aspects of daily locomotor rhythms. Furthermore, recent studies showed that a robust locomotor rhythm \nis an emergent property of a combination of different \nrhythms in different clusters of clock neurons, and that selectively activating or inactivating those clusters causes predictable changes in the activity patterns of flies\n138– 140. \nSuch differences in rhythmicity of clock neurons are a \nfunction of differential expression of clock genes25 and \ndownstream factors, and of differential coupling to other clock cells through neuromodulators — notably PDF\n141 \n— and through diurnal circuit remodelling of synaptic connections (reviewed in\n142,143). In fact, clock neurons \nand glia cells change their synaptic partners rhythmi­cally across day and night, suggesting that the brain \ncircuitry itself undergoes circadian plasticity\n144,145. Glia \nthemselves have a well­ documented yet relatively under ­\nstudied role in the central pacemaker (reviewed in146). \nDifferent clusters of clock neurons have been implicated \nin regulating different rhythmic behaviours, including \neclosion, locomotion, feeding, mating, courtship and temperature preference (see below)\n147.

A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191. There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",

High levels of serotonin are constitutively produced in the pineal gland \n Fig. (1). Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photore-ceptors in the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothala-mus, via retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendo-crine rhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phase-dependent manner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic representation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the SCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and release norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the light phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orches-tration of nocturnal rhythms of humans.

            "originalText": ". \nWith the brief duration of exposure to each individual light flash, there may be an insufficient number of retinal \n(ipRGC) circuits activated for some of the flashes. This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31.

This could lead to discontinuity in the flash signal (i.e., ipRGC \ncould stop signaling continuously), which reduces the impact of the flashes on the circadian  clock16.\nExposure to a sequence of light flashes during wake can be an aversive experience. Thus, light flashes have \npreviously been used in field studies of individuals while they are  asleep20. This is also at the time during which \nthe circadian clock is most sensitive to  light9,28. To be useful in the field, however, the light flashes must not \nactively interfere with sleep. In one previous study, we found no evidence for a different sequence of light flashes \nto interfere with PSG-recorded  sleep18. In the current study, PSG indicated no substantive differences between \nsham and flash therapy in sleep quality and architecture. We examined PSG using traditional scoring meth-\nods, spectral analysis, and sleep state probability analysis. We were unable to observe significant differences in \nsleep architecture and probability scoring due to the flashes. Despite our potential lack of statistical power to \nidentify subtle changes in flash-induced sleep architecture or power, we did have the capability to detect gross \ndisturbances in sleep, with an accuracy threshold of 4.8 min of wakefulness or more. However, we did find some \nevidence for small flash-induced changes in the number of transitions from sleep to wake and deep to light sleep, \nand an enhancement of delta activity in the light flash condition. This delta enhancement is likely secondary to \nan evoked response rather than a true induction of delta  activity18. In one participant, there was much more wake \nduring the 1-h light flash exposure, however, this participant was awake prior to the onset of the light flashes and \nthe presence of the light flashes likely made falling asleep very difficult (they did go to sleep after cessation of \nthe flashes). The light flash sequence was administered at the beginning of the sleep period, so under the high -\nest homeostatic pressure, which may have reduced the likelihood of the flashes causing an acute arousal. In one \nprevious field study in adolescents, light flashes were administered at the end of the sleep period, during which \nthere was greatly reduced homeostatic pressure, and yet no self-reported evidence of sleep disruption when the \nduration of the light flash exposure was limited to 2   h20. The impact of light flashes on sleep architecture and \nspectral power reported here and in previous  studies18 appears to be relatively modest; nonetheless, it’s important \nto approach the safety assessment of short (1 h) exposure flash therapy with care. Moderate-intensity continuous \nlight (100 lx) given throughout sleep has been shown to potentially have adverse effects on  health29, while lower \nintensity (40 lx) given throughout the night can affect sleep architecture and spectral  power30.\nBy placing light flashes near the beginning of sleep, the light flashes were predominantly administrated during \nN2 and N3 sleep, with very little wake, N1, or REM occurring (Fig.  2). With the limited range of sleep stages, we \ndid not observe any direct interaction between sleep stage and the magnitude of phase shift elicited by the light \nflashes. Sleep can directly impact the electrophysiologic characteristics of the SCN and, in theory, could change \nthe response of the SCN to the light flash  stimuli31. Experiments with shorter-duration stimuli that are proactively \nassigned to be administered during specific stages of sleep would be needed to answer this question definitively.\nLimitations of real-world implications arise from certain aspects of our study design.
