This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of elec -\ntronic and vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone \nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The \nshoulder (λ  ≈ 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corre -\nsponds to this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective \nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecu -\nlar plasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent \ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules \ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal \nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The \nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation) \nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of \nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading \nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary \nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting the vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1 \nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in \nSupplementary Videos 2–4, respectively, obtained from first-principles \nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm calculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density \nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT), \nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at \n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short lon -\ngitudinal charge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with \ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended \nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations \ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of \nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions \nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400–600 nm) are inac -\ncurately overestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm−1 \n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 × 1013 s−1) \nfor 1,1′,3,3,3′,3′-hexamethyl-4,4′,5,5′-dibenzo-2,2′-indotricarbocyanine \nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy \nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the \nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18. \nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption \nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode, \nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm−1 corresponds to \nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration. \nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to \ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value \n(~1,310–1,375 cm−1) in indocyanine structures.
