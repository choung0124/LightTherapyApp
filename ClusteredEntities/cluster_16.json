            "originalText": "interactions and grooming, both sexes were compromised more in the mutant mice ( Table 5).  \nIn short, although we powered our sample size to detect possible sex differences, for the most \npart, both sexes were impacted by the Cntnap2  mutation. As measured by grooming, the \nrepetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.  \nReduced melanopic  illumination diminishe d DLaN induction of c -Fos in the basolateral \namygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.   \nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several \nbrain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018). Hence, t o unravel some of the possible mechanism s underlying the \nimpacts of DLaN on autistic behavior s, we examined c- Fos immunoreactivity  across different \nbrain regions  known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA,  \nPeriventricular  Nucleus  (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus  (LH). For controls, we also examined \npossible DLaN driven c -Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from \nipRGC including the SCN and per i-Habenular nucleus  (pHb). Compared to mice held on a \nstandard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short 位 enriched \nDLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c -Fos positive cells in both the BLA and \npHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6 ). In contrast, the long 位 enriched \nDLaN did not induced c- Fos expression in any of these regions.  Prior work suggested that the \nglutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive \nbehavior  (Felix -Ortiz  et al., 2016 ).  Therefore , we crossed the Cntnap2  KO line into  mice that \nexpressed both vGAT 2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre -dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) \n(Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling . WT and Cntnap2 KO mice wit h \nthese reporters were then exposed to short 位 enriched DLaN  for two weeks . The expression of \nthe vGlut2 -ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust  in both the WT and mutants . \nMost  importantly , the short 位 DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2- ZsGreen1/cFos \nimmunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice ( Table 7) in comparison  to the WT under DLaN or the \nWT and mutants under LD conditions . Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-\nexpression in the light treated group ( Table 7). These data suggest that the glutamatergic cells \nwithin the BLA are activated by DLaN and raise the possibility that this cell population \ncontributes to its effect on repetitive behavior.    \n \n \nDiscussion  .

            "originalText": "and sex -matched WT.  S ocial deficits were observed in mutants of  both sexes. Hence, both \nsexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive \nbehavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work h as found \nthat LPS -induced maternal immune activation caused male- specific deficits in behavior and \ngene expression in the Cntnap2 KO lin e (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked \nwhether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by \nDLaN treatment.  In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interac tions), we found that \nboth sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN ( Table 5;  S. Fig. 2 ).  The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

            "originalText": "e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erb伪, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.

The females Cntnap2 \nKO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still \noverall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 \nmutation and the negative influence of DLaN.   \n \nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c -Fos expression in several \nbrain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; \nFernandez et al., 2018).   We sought to determine whether the 2- weeks of DLaN would alter c -\nFos expression in some of those brain regions ( Fig. 7).  In contrast to the effects of the light \nwhen the mice were held in DD ( Fig. 1 ), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly \nhigh melanopic illumination increased c -Fos in the SCN.  Similarly, we did not see increased c -\nFos expression in the PVH and LH .  Interestingly, the  chemogenetic  activation of ipRGCs, did \ninduced c -Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016).  The difference may \nwell be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study  or the difference between \nacute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN.  We did fi nd that our high \nmelanopic DLaN did increases c -Fos expression in the pHb and BLA.  Prior work has implicated \nthe pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018) .  \nSpecifically , there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the \npHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)  to drive depressive- like behaviors  (An et al., \n2020).  Thus , we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our \nmouse models  (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020)  and this will be \nan important area for future work . More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that \nthe BLA may regulate repetitive behavior  (Felix -Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019).  Using a \nreporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c -Fos induction \noccurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA \n(Fig. 7 ).     .

            "originalText": "e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin peak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which may be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchro-nicity of clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erb伪, Clock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177]. In addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic expression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desyn-chronized Per1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179]. Agomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated for treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and temperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined the major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the regulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body tempera-ture cycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of periph-eral oscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing os-cillations).   In addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], mela-tonin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that mela-tonin could also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas. Besides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippo-campus, first modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation of CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism involving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor [184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in glutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185]. Altogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may act in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which opens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system based drugs.
