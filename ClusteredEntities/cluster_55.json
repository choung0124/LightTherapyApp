These results suggest that there \nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of \nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3  and Extended Data Fig. 2). The \nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine \nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended \nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the per -\nmeabilization of the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine \nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4 ); at this wavelength, the \nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed \nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting \n1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye \nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already \npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell per -\nmeabilization) was 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold \nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH \nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is \nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b–d ). The DiD dye \nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity \nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with \na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity \nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluo -\nrescence of DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f ). \nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark \nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of \na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote \nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might \noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent \nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f ). This is further confirmed and \ndiscussed later using 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as \niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong pho -\ntosensitizers24,25. Therefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to \nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing the cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and \nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media \nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with \nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath \n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and 2 °C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was \nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Thus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen \nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not respon -\nsible for the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells \nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data  \nFig. 7a–c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea \n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization \nof the cells.

This eﬀect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the elec-\ntron density along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlengthofthepolymethinebridgeinﬂuencestheplasmonicityand\ntherebythevibroniceﬀecttopermeabilizecells(Figure S18,Sup-\nporting Information). The longer the 𝜋-conjugation, the higher\ntheplasmonicityindex.Thisisconsistentwiththeoreticalcalcu-\nlationsthatpredictthattheplasmonicityindexshouldbedirectly\nproportional to the number of atoms in polyaromatic hydrocar-\nbon systems.[33]3) The addition of a fused benzene ring to the\nindole increases the plasmonicity and thereby the VDA activity\nbecauseitincreasesthe 𝜋-conjugationandthenumberofatoms\nthat can support the plasmon oscillation (Figure S19, Support-\ningInformation).Incontrast,thelackoffusedbenzenemoieties\nsuchasinCy7-amineandCy5-aminelimitsthemolecularplas-\nmon oscillation of the electron density in the transverse direc-\ntion. The weak TMP resonance is observed in the UV–vis spec-\ntrum of Cy7-amine at ≈380 nm in Figure S14(Supporting In-\nformation) and Cy5-amine at ≈320 nm in Figure S15(Support-\ning Information). 4) Substitution of the indole by other alterna-\ntive resonance structures, such as 1-methylquinoline, weakens\nthe plasmonicity and the VDA activity (Figure S20, Supporting\nInformation).

            "originalText": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common\nneurodegenerative disorder, and, owing to the agingpopulation, the number of patients with PD is\nexpected to double by 2030.\n1Projected PD prevalence will\nbe more than 1.6 million in the US with projected total eco-nomic burden surpassing $79 billion by 2037.\n2The diagno-\nsisofPDisbasedontheclinicalmanifestationsandfindingsfrom complex neuroimaging examinations, such as mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angi-ography (MRA), which contribute to medical burden amongpatients with PD. Therefore, besides the established diag-nostic method, many studies have been conducted to inves-tigate the potential metrics for PD, translating these intoclinically practical tools for the diagnosis and treatment ofpatients with PD.\nThe unique features of the retina make it a useful\nassessment tool for various systemic diseases. First, theretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be exam-ined noninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting bio-metric data associated with cardiovascular risks, attemptsto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predictingthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographshave been made by several studies; these attempts haveyielded encouraging results.\n3-7Cho et al7reported predict-\ning coronary calcium score based on the fundus photo-graphs with other biometrics showing an area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757(95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Second, due to a common embryonicorigin, the brain and retina share many biological featuresthatplayaprominentroleinthepathogenesisofmajorneu-rodegenerative diseases, including PD.\n8-18Recent studies\nhave reported that PD progression is associated with thestructural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and sug-gest the potential role of the retina as a modality for assess-ing PD progression.\n16-21Recently, deep learning algorithms\nhave been used in several medical fields. Even though deeplearningalgorithmsareconsideredblackboxlearningmeth-ods (ie, the machine learning model provides a result with-out explaining how that result was derived), these algo-rithms permit clinicians to seek new associations andfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analyticmethods and human participants.\n1-5The application of vari-\nousdeeplearningmethodstopredictcardiovasculardiseaserisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photogra-phy is already well known.\n6,7Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural forresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus pho-tographs using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and UnifiedParkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evalua-tion metric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we devel-opedadeeplearningalgorithmtopredictboththeH-Yscaleand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography amongpatients with PD. Moreover, heat maps were evaluated inthe macular area to confirm the anatomic association of ouralgorithm’s function. Furthermore, external validation forthe assessment function of this algorithm was conductedusing 2 independent hospital data sets to test the functionof our algorithm in different clinical settings.Methods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThisdecisionanalyticalmodel,conductedfromMay1toSep-tember 30, 2021, adheres to the tenets of the Declaration ofHelsinki.

The heptamethine bridge (C7) can be chemically conjugated with indole to form Cy7 or with benzoindole to form Cy7.5. These structural elements, polymethine and indole or benzoindole, hybridize to from a coupled system with the molecular plasmon-dominated longitudinally by the polymethine bridge \n(LMP in purple) and transversally by the indole or benzoindole (TMP in teal). \nHowever, these structures are hybridized and the electronic conjugation of the benzoindole influences the polymethine bridge and vice versa. (b ) Summary of \nstructures in this study. The observed effect on the cell killing is summarized for each structure, and each lists the common name of the conjugate backbone. The addend function is listed for each.",

( a) Important MJH structural elements. LMP \n= longitudinal molecular plasmon. TMP = transversal molecular plasmon. The strength of the molecular plasmon (VDA) is expected to be proportional to \nthe length of the π-conjugation. The π-conjugation can be increased in two \nways: 1) increasing the length of polymethine bridge and 2) increasing the size of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fused to the indole.
