In the 3xTg model, the\nbrain has elevated levels of microglia-produced pro-inﬂammatory\ncytokines (Park et al., 2021) and microglia activation and\nproliferation can be observed before the development of A bplaques\n(Janelsins et al., 2005). We observe activated microglia in 3xTg\nmice at 13 mo, where they cluster around A bplaques and display\na more amoeboid morphology ( Figure 2A ). Microglia depletionin AD models decreases neuroinﬂammatory signaling without\nacutely altering amyloid and tau pathology and in some studies\ncan partially restore memory deﬁcits (Spangenberg et al., 2016).\nWe hypothesized that activated microglia and neuroinﬂammation\ncould contribute to the circadian re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice and microglia depletion would rescue the\nre-entrainment phenotype.

This eﬀect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the elec-\ntron density along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlengthofthepolymethinebridgeinﬂuencestheplasmonicityand\ntherebythevibroniceﬀecttopermeabilizecells(Figure S18,Sup-\nporting Information).

The weak TMP resonance is observed in the UV–vis spec-\ntrum of Cy7-amine at ≈380 nm in Figure S14(Supporting In-\nformation) and Cy5-amine at ≈320 nm in Figure S15(Support-\ning Information). 4) Substitution of the indole by other alterna-\ntive resonance structures, such as 1-methylquinoline, weakens\nthe plasmonicity and the VDA activity (Figure S20, Supporting\nInformation).

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid- b\n(Ab) plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate A bclearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms signiﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal’s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a “jet lag” protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nﬁrst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of A bplaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.\nSex-speciﬁc circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulseof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent “jet lag.” This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (González-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running",

To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the re-\nentrainment phenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied re-\nentrainment in 5xFAD mice.

For exam-\nple,fromFigure S42(SupportingInformation)weidentiﬁedthat\nthecarboxylatedGL-261-2waslesstoxicthantheaminocyanines.\nFollowingthisobservation,wesynthesizedBL-242(Figure S43E,\nSupportingInformation).Theacetylationoftheaminesuchasin\nGL-362-2 enhanced the toxicity (Figure S43E, Supporting Infor-\nmation).Overall,nodirectcorrelationbetweenthelight-activatedVDAactivity,andtheinherenttoxicitywasobserved(Figure S43A\nvs FigureS43B, Supporting Information). The ratio of inherent\ntoxicity/VDA activity was deﬁned to identify the lead molecule\nwiththehighesttherapeuticindexofVDAactivityversusinher-\nenttoxicity(Figure S43C,SupportingInformation).Speciﬁcally,\nthe therapeutic index was deﬁned as the ratio of Tox LC50/VDA\nLC50.BL-141-2hasaconvenienthightherapeuticindexof22and\nav e r yl o wV D AL C50=18 nm to eradicate 50% of the cells and\nVDA LC100=40 nm to eradicate 100% of the cells. GL-261-2 is\nthe lead molecule with the highest therapeutic index of 62 and\naV D AL C50=80 nm (Figure S43D, Supporting Information).\nGL-261-2, with a therapeutic index of ≈60, is a plasmon-driven\nMJH candidate for translation to rodent studies, which is safer\nthan Cy7.5-amine (therapeutic index of ≈2–5 depending on the\nmethod used) that was successfully applied in vivo to eradicate\nmelanomatumorswithoutsignsoftoxicsideeﬀectsinmice.[23]\n3.Conclusion\nA library of 23 NIR 730 nm light-activated MJH displaying\nplasmon-driven vibrational action was designed and synthe-\nsized (Figures 1,2). This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identiﬁcation\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabi-\nlizecellularmembranes.Thecontributionofeachstructuralele-\nment to the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantiﬁed by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13,a n dS17–S20, Supporting Information).\nTheplasmonicitywasimprovedbysynthesizingmoleculessuch\nasGL-308-2andBL-204(Figure S12,SupportingInformation).\nThe EPIis a method described hereto quantify theeﬀects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH. The theoretical\nplasmonicityindex,basedoncomplexquantummechanicalcal-\nculations,hasbeendescribedelsewhere.[44,45]TheEPIcorrelates\nwiththeVDAactivitywhencomparingMJHwiththesameside\nchainsbutvariablecores(Figure 3C;F iguresS17–S20,Support-\ningInformation).\nMJH Cy5.5-amine binds to the cellular membrane, nuclear\nmembrane,andmitochondria(Figure S23,SupportingInforma-\ntion). In the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged car-\ndiolipin, a phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the ﬂow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Simi-\nlarmoleculessuchasCy7.5-amine,Cy7-amine,Cy5.5-amine,and\nCy5-amine should also dock into the lipid bilayers. It was con-\nﬁrmedthatCy7-aminetargetslocalizationincellularmembranes\nlike Cy5.5-amine (Figure S35, Supporting Information). This is\nsupporting evidence",
