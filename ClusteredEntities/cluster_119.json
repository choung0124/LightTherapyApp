Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiacdeath [ 71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deﬁciency oroverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repo-larization, and enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [ 72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevatedrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a “potentialcarcinogen” [ 73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug adminis-tration is considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efﬁcacy of somechemotherapeutic agents [ 74,75]. These observations in humans support an inti-\nmate connection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared componentsbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation ofmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates acompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.Circadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) andcyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [ 76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n/C0//C0;Cry2/C0//C0mice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [ 76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genesis deregulated in breast cancer [ 77].

A notable exception \nare embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem \ncells, which do not exhibit a functional molecular clock \ncycle although circadian rhythms in glucose utilization  \nare still observed189– 191. There is ample evidence that \nperipheral clocks in different organs are essential for \ntheir function. For example, mice manipulated to have \nthe circadian clock operate only in the brain show nor ­\nmal rhythms but not overall levels of locomotor activ­ity; conversely, normal activity levels and body weight  \nare achieved by a having a functioning circadian clock  \nonly in muscles, despite exhibiting behavioural arrhy­thmicity\n192. Other examples of the necessity of peri­\npheral clocks in mammals include the control of glucose \nhomeo  stasis by the liver and pancreatic clocks, ovula­\ntion by the ovarian clock, wound healing by the skin \nclock and energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypo  thalamus clock\n193– 197 (Fig.  5). In addition to these \nnot entirely unexpected examples, some surprising rela­\ntionships have also emerged whose mechanistic basis  \nis still unclear, such as control of sleep by BMAL1 in \nskeletal muscle rather than the brain198.\nCircadian physiology is generally the result of cyclic \nexpression of clock­ controlled genes downstream of the \ncore molecular oscillator. Although clocks are ubiqui­tous throughout the body, the nature, number and phase of rhythmically expressed genes is highly tissue­ specific \nin mice, non­ human primates and humans\n10,78,199, 200. \nThis limited overlap may be explained at least in part \nby organ­ specific needs of circadian output. For exam­\nple, in the heart, cyclic expression of ion channels and \nmetabolic enzymes enables diurnal variations in cardiac electrical properties and metabolism, which match daily \nfluctuations in energy demand and nutrient availabil­\nity\n201– 204. In the skin, clock­ controlled expression of cell \ncycle and DNA repair genes mediates rhythmic prolif­\neration and sensitivity to ultraviolet­ induced DNA dam­\nage205,206, whereas in the kidneys, circadian oscillations \nin the rate of glomerular filtration and in ion excre­tion coincide with rhythmic expression of membrane \ntransporters\n207.\nWithin the largely organ­ specific circadian tran­\nscriptome, the core clock genes represent the group of genes cyclically expressed in the highest number of different tissues and with the most consistent phase across all tissues, suggesting the existence of an over ­\nall shared molecular circadian oscillator in different organs, despite their unique profiles of clock output genes. This apparent paradox can in fact be explained by diverse manners in which molecular clocks and cell­ \ntype­specific transcription regulators are functionally \nintegrated. First, some core clock components have well­ defined functions in addition to their role in the \nmolecular clock, and these pleiotropic functions can \nwww.nature.com/nrmReviews\n",
